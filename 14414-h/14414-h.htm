<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>While Edwin Waugh and Ben Brierley have done much to perpetuate
the rude moorland and busy factory life of Lancashire, little has
been done to perpetuate the stern Puritanism of the hill sects.</p>

<p>Among these sects there is a poetry and simplicity local in
character, yet delightful in spirit; and to recall and record it is
the aim of the following Idylls.</p>

<p>The provincialism of Lancashire varies with its valleys. It is
only necessary, therefore, to remark that as these Idylls are drawn
from a once famous valley in the North-east division of the county,
the provincialism is peculiar to that valley&mdash;indeed, it would
be more correct to say, to that section of the valley wherein
Rehoboth lies.</p>

<h3>I.</h3><h3>A MOORLAND MACHPELAH.</h3>

<p>There was a sepulchral tone in the voice, and well there might
be, for it was a voice from the grave. Floating on the damp autumnal
air, and echoing round the forest of tombs, it died away over the
moors, on the edge of which the old God's-acre stood.</p>

<p>Though far from melodious, it was distinct enough to convey to
the ear the words of a well-known hymn&mdash;a hymn sung in jerky
fragments, the concluding syllable always rising and ending with a
gasp, as though the singer found his task too heavy, and was bound
to pause for breath.</p>

<p>The startled listener was none other than Mr.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page14" id="page14" title="14"></a>
Penrose, the newly-appointed minister, who was awaiting a funeral,
long overdue. Looking round, his already pale face became a shade
paler as he saw no living form, other than himself.</p>

<p>There he stood, alone, a stranger in this moorland haunt, amid
falling shadows and rounding gloom, mocked by the mute records and
stony memorials of the dead.</p>

<p>Again the voice was heard&mdash;another hymn, and to a tune as
old as the mossed headstones that threw around their lengthening
shadows.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">
&lsquo;I'll praise my Maker&mdash;while I've breath,&rsquo;
</blockquote>
<p>followed by a pause, as though breath had actually forsaken the body
of the singer. But in a moment or two the strain continued:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">
&lsquo;And when my voice&mdash;is lost in death.&rsquo;
</blockquote>
<p>Whereon the sounds ceased, and there came a final silence, death
seeming to take the singer at his word.</p>

<p>As Mr. Penrose looked in the direction from which the voice
travelled, he saw a shovel thrown out of a newly-made grave,
followed by the steaming head and weather-worn face of old
<a class="pagebreak" name="page15" id="page15" title="15"></a>
Joseph, the sexton, all aglow with the combined task of
grave-digging and singing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, Joseph, is it you? I couldn't tell where the sound
came from. It seems, after all, the grave can praise God, although
the prophet tells us it cannot. Do you always sing at your
work?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Partly whod. You see it's i' this way, sir,&rsquo; said
Joseph; &lsquo;grave-diggin's hard wark, and if a felley doesn'd
sing a bit o'er it he's like baan to curse, so I sings to stop
swears. There's a fearful deal o' oaths spilt in a grave while it's
i' th' makin', I can tell yo'; and th' Almeety's name is spoken more
daan i' th' hoile than it is up aboon, for all th' parson reads it
so mich aat of his book. But this funeral's baan to be lat', Mr.
Penrose&rsquo;; and drawing a huge watch from his fob, he exclaimed:
&lsquo;Another ten minutes and there's no berryin' i' th' yard this
afternoon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don't understand you, Joseph,&rsquo; said Mr. Penrose
wonderingly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We never berry here after four o'clock.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But there's no law forbidding a funeral at any hour that I
know of&mdash;is there?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page16" id="page16" title="16"></a>
<p>&lsquo;There is wi' me. I'm maisther o' this berryin' hoile,
whatever yo' may be o' th' chapel. But they're comin', so I'll oppen
th' chapel durs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Old Joseph, as he was called, had been grave-digger at Rehoboth
for upwards of fifty years, and so rooted were his customs that none
cared to call them in question. For minister and deacons he showed
little respect. Boys and girls fled from before his shadow; and the
village mothers frightened their offspring when naughty by
threatening to &lsquo;fotch owd Joseph to put them in th'
berryhoile.&rsquo; The women held him in awe, declaring that he sat
up at night in the graveyard to watch for corpse-candles. Even the
shrewd and hard-headed did not care to thwart him, preferring to be
friends rather than foes. Fathers, sons and sons'
sons&mdash;generation after generation&mdash;had been laid to rest
by the sinewy arms of Joseph.  They came, and they departed; but he,
like the earth, remained. A gray, gaunt Tithonus, him &lsquo;only
cruel immortality consumed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The graveyard at Rehoboth was his kingdom. Here, among the tombs,
he reigned with undisputed
<a class="pagebreak" name="page17" id="page17" title="17"></a>
sway. Whether marked by lettered stone or grassy mound, it mattered
little&mdash;he knew where each rude forefather of the hamlet lay.
Rich in the family lore of the neighbourhood, he could trace back
ancestry and thread his way through the maze of relationship to the
third and fourth generations. He could recount the sins which had
hurried men to untimely graves, and point to the spot where their
bones were rotting; and he could tell of virtues that made the
memory of the mouldering dust more fragrant than the sweetbriar and
the rose that grew upon the graves.</p>

<p>There was one rule which old Joseph would never break, and that
was that there should be no interments after four o'clock. Plead
with him, press him, threaten him, it was to no purpose; flinch he
would not for rich or for poor, for parson or for people. More
than once he had driven the mourners back from the gates, and one
winter's afternoon, when the corpse had been brought a long
distance, it was left for the night in a neighbouring barn. Upon
this occasion a riot was with difficulty averted. But old Joseph
stood firm, and at the risk of his life carried the day.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page18" id="page18" title="18"></a>
This was long years ago. Now, throughout the whole countryside it
was known that no corpse passed through Rehoboth gates after four
o'clock.</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>&lsquo;You'll happen look in an' see th' owd woman afore yo' go
wom',&rsquo; said Joseph to Mr. Penrose, as the minister finished
his entry of the funeral in the chapel register, &lsquo;hoo's nobbud
cratchenly (shaky).&rsquo;</p>

<p>Joseph and his wife lived in the lower room of a three-storied
cottage at the end of the chapel, the second and third stories of
the said cottage being utilized by the Rehoboth members as
Sunday-schools.</p>

<p>Entering, Mr. Penrose saw the old woman crouching over the hearth
and doing her best to feed the fast-dying fires of her vitality.  As
she raised her wrinkled face, crowned with white hair and covered
with a coloured kerchief, a gray shawl wrapped round her lean and
stooping shoulders, she smiled a welcome, and bade him be
seated.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So yo'n put away owd Chris,&rsquo; she said, as soon as
Mr. Penrose had taken his seat by her
<a class="pagebreak" name="page19" id="page19" title="19"></a>
side. &lsquo;Well, he were awlus one for sleepin'.  Th' owd felley
would a slept on a clooas-line if he could a' fun nowhere else to
lay hissel. But he'll sleep saander or ever naa.  They'll bide some
wakkenin' as sleep raand here, Mr. Penrose. Did he come in a yerst,
or were he carried?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He was carried,&rsquo; answered the minister, somewhat in
uncertainty as to the meaning of the old woman's question.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I were awlus for carryin'. I make nowt o' poor folk apein'
th' quality, and when they're deead and all. Them as keeps carriages
while they're wick can ride in yersts to their berryin' if they
like, it's nowt to me; but when I dee I's be carried, and noan so
far, noather.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This moralizing on funerals by the sexton's wife was a new phase
of life to Mr. Penrose. He had never before met with anyone who took
an interest in the matter. It was true that in the city from which
he had lately come the question of wicker coffins and of cremation
was loudly discussed; but the choice between a hearse and
&lsquo;carrying&rsquo; as a means of transit to the tomb never
dawned on him as being anything else
<a class="pagebreak" name="page20" id="page20" title="20"></a>
than a question of utility&mdash;the speediest and easiest means of
transit.</p>

<p>After the deliverance of her mind on the snobbishness of poor
people in the use of the hearse, she continued:</p>

<p>&lsquo;It'll noan be so long afore they've to carry me, Mr.
Penrose. I towd Joseph yesterneet that his turn 'ud soon come to dig
my grave wi' th' rest; and he said, &ldquo;When thy turn comes,
lass, I'll do by thee as thou'd be done by.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And how would you be done by?&rsquo; asked the
minister.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, it's i' this way, Mr. Penrose,&rsquo; said the old
woman. &lsquo;I want a dry grave, wi' a posy growin' on th' top. I
somehaa like posies on graves; they mak' me think of th' owd
hymn,</p>

<blockquote>
&lsquo;&ldquo;There everlastin' spring abides,<br />
And never-witherin' flaars.&rdquo;&rsquo;
</blockquote>

<p>Now, Mr. Penrose was one of the so-called theological young
bloods, and held little sympathy with Dr. Watts's sensuous views of
a future state. His common-sense, however, and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page21" id="page21" title="21"></a>
his discretion came to his rescue, and delivered him from a strong
temptation to blast the old woman's paradise with a breath of
negative criticism.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There's a grave daan at th' bottom o' th' yard, Mr.
Penrose, where th' sunleet rests from morn till neet, an' I've axed
Joseph to lay me there, for it's welly awlus warm, and flaars grow
from Kesmas to Kesmas. Th' doctor's little lass lies there. Yo never
knowd her, Mr. Penrose. Hoo were some pratty, bless her! Did yo'
ever read what her faither put o'er th' top o' th' stone?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose confessed he was in ignorance of the epitaph over the
grave of the doctor's child. As yet the history and romance of the
graveyard were unknown to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, it's this,&rsquo; continued his informant:</p>
<blockquote class="inline">
&lsquo;&ldquo;Such lilies th' angels gather for th' garden of God.&rdquo;
</blockquote>
<p>They'll never write that o'er me, Mr. Penrose. I'm nobbud a withered
stalk. Hoo were eight&mdash;I'm eighty. But for all that I should
like a flaar on mi grave, and Joseph says I shall hev
one.&rsquo;</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<a class="pagebreak" name="page22" id="page22" title="22"></a>
<p>The autumn gave place to a long and cheerless winter, which all
too slowly yielded to a late and nipping spring. The wild March
wind swept across the moors, roaring loudly around the old
conventicle, chasing the last year's leaves in a mad whirl among
the rows of headstones, and hissing, as though in anger, through
the rank grasses growing on the innumerable mounds that marked the
underlying dead, and then careering off, as though wrathful at its
powerlessness to disturb the sleepers, to distant farmsteads and
lone folds where starved ewes cowered with their early lambs under
shivering thorns, and old men complained of the blast that roused
the slumbering rheum and played havoc with their feeble frames.
Scanty snow showers fell late under &lsquo;the roaring moon of
daffodil,&rsquo; whitening the moorlands and lying glistening in the
morning light, to be gathered up by the rays of the sun that day
by day climbed higher in the cold blue of the sky of spring. Young
blades of green lay scattered like emerald shafts amid the tawny
wastes of the winter grass, and swelling branches told of a year's
returning life. Just as the golden chalice of the first crocus
<a class="pagebreak" name="page23" id="page23" title="23"></a>
opened on the graves of the Rehoboth burial-yard, the old woman at
the chapel-house died.</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>The funeral was to take place at three o'clock, but long before
the hour old Joseph's kitchen was filled with a motley group of
mourners. They came from far and near, from moor and field, and from
the cottages over the way. Every branch of the family was
represented&mdash;sons and daughters, grandchildren, nephews and
nieces, even to babies in arms. As they straggled in, the women
attired in their best black, and the men wearing their top-hats (a
headgear worn by the Lancashire operative only on the state occasion
of funerals), it seemed as though old Joseph, like Abraham, was the
father of a race as the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the
sands by the seashore, innumerable.</p>

<p>An oppressive atmosphere filled the room, where, on a table under
the window, the open coffin rested, in which lay, exposed to all
eyes, the peaceful features and straightened limbs of the dead. As
the mourners entered they bent
<a class="pagebreak" name="page24" id="page24" title="24"></a>
reverently over the corpse, and moistened its immobile features with
their tears, whispering kindly words as to the appearance the old
woman wore in death, and calling to mind some characteristic grace
and virtue in her past life.</p>

<p>On another table was stacked a number of long clay pipes with
tobacco, from which the men assisted themselves, smoking with the
silence and stolidity of Indians, the women preserving the same mute
attitude, save for an occasional groan and suppressed sigh&mdash;the
feminine method in Lancashire of mourning for the dead.</p>

<p>The last mourners had long arrived, and the company was seated in
an attitude of hushed and painful expectancy for the officiating
minister. There was no sign, however, of his appearance; and the
mourners asked themselves in silence if he who was to perform the
final rites for the dead had forgotten the hour or the day.</p>

<p>The fingers of the old clock slowly crept along the dial-plate
towards four, the hour so relentlessly enforced for interments for
half a century by the sexton, who was now about to
<a class="pagebreak" name="page25" id="page25" title="25"></a>
lay away his own wife in the greedy maw of the grave. The monotonous
oscillation of the pendulum, sounding as the stroke of a passing
bell, gathered solemnity of tone in the felt hush that rested upon
all in the room&mdash;a hush as deep as that which rested upon the
dead. All eyes, under the cover of stealthily drooping lids, stole
glances at old Joseph, whose face fought hard to hide the emotions
running like pulsing tides beneath the surface. At last a woman,
whose threescore years and ten was the only warrant for her rude
interruption, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wheer's th' parson? Hes he forgetten, thinksto?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mr. Penrose is ill i' bed,&rsquo; replied old Joseph,
&lsquo;but I seed Mr.  Hanson fra Burnt Hill Chapel, and he promised
as he'd be here in his place.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The clock beat out its seconds with the same monotonous sound,
and the finger crept towards the fateful hour. Then came the wheeze
and whir preliminary to the strokes of four, conveying to familiar
ears that only eight more minutes remained. At this warning Joseph
arose from his seat, and, walking out into the graveyard, made
direct to an eminence overlooking
<a class="pagebreak" name="page26" id="page26" title="26"></a>
the long trend of road, and, raising one hand to shade his now
failing sight, looked down the valley to see if the minister was on
his way to the grave. It was in vain. Tears began to dim his sight,
and for a moment the man overcame the sexton. The struggle was but
brief; in another moment he was again the sexton. Returning to the
cottage, he scarcely reached the threshold before he cried out, with
all the firmness of his cruelly professional tones:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Parson or no parson, aat o' this dur (door) hoo goes at
four o'clock.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As the clock struck the fateful hour the old woman was carried to
her grave; and as they lowered her, Joseph, with uncovered head, let
fall the clods from his own hand, repeating, in a hoarse yet
tremulous voice, the words:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In another moment the old sexton reeled, and fell into the arms
of the men who stood near him. It was but a passing weakness, for he
soon pulled himself together, and accompanied the mourners to the
funeral tea, which was served in a neighbouring house.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page27" id="page27" title="27"></a>
<p>Never afterwards, however, was old Joseph heard to rail at
mourners when late, or known to close the Rehoboth gates against an
overdue funeral.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page28" id="page28" title="28"></a>
<a name="chapter1.2" id="chapter1.2"></a>
<h3>II.</h3><h3>A CHILD OF THE HEATHER.</h3>

<p>&lsquo;What, Milly! Sitting in the dark?&rsquo; asked Mr.
Penrose, as he entered the chamber of the suffering child, who was
gazing through the open window at the silent stars.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I were just lookin' at th' parish candles, as my faither
co's 'em; they burn breetsome to-neet, sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Looking at them, or looking for them?&rsquo; queried the
somewhat perplexed divine. &lsquo;Can I bring the candles to
you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yo' cornd bring 'em ony nearer than they are. They're up
yon, sithi,&rsquo; and so saying the child pointed to the evening
sky.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So you call the stars &ldquo;parish candles,&rdquo; do
you?&rsquo; smilingly inquired Mr. Penrose. &lsquo;I never heard
them called by that name before.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page29" id="page29" title="29"></a>
<p>&lsquo;It's my faither co's 'em &ldquo;parish candles,&rdquo; not
me,&rsquo; said the child.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what do you call them?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Happen if I tell yo' yo'll laugh at me, as my faither
does.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I shall not. You need not be afraid.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I co 'em angels' een (eyes).&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A far prettier name than your father gives to them,
Milly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' what dun yo' think hoo co's th' dew as it lies fresh
on th' moors in a mornin'?&rsquo; asked the mother, who was sitting
in one of the shadowed corners of the room.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I cannot say, I am sure, Mrs. Lord. Milly has such
wonderful names for everything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, hoo co's it angels' tears, and says it drops daan
fro' th' een o' them as watches fro' aboon at the devilment they see
on th' earth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Milly, you are a poetess!&rsquo; exclaimed the delighted
minister. &lsquo;But do you really think the angels weep? Would it
not destroy the joy of that place where sorrow and sighing are no
more?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, yo' see, it's i' this road, Mr. Penrose. They say as
th' angels are glad when bad folk
<a class="pagebreak" name="page30" id="page30" title="30"></a>
turn good, and I suppose they'll fret theirsels a bit if th' bad
folk keeps bad; and there's mony o' that mak' abaat here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr, Penrose was silent. Once more Milly was, unknown to herself
furnishing him with thoughts; for, again and again, from the sickbed
of this child had he gone forth with fresh fields of revelation
opening before him. True, the idea of heaven's grief at earth's sin
was not a pleasant one; but if joy at righteousness and repentance,
why not grief at wickedness and hardness of heart?</p>

<p>While thus musing in the quiet of the darkening chamber, Milly
turned from her contemplation of the stars with the somewhat
startling question:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mr. Penrose, dun yo' think there'll be yethbobs (tufts of
heather) i' heaven?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That's bothered her a deal latly,&rsquo; broke in the
mother, with a choking voice. &lsquo;Hoo sez hoo noan cares for
heaven if hoo cornd play on th' moors, and yer th' wind, and poo
yethbobs when hoo gets there. What dun yo' think abaat it, Mr.
Penrose?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose was not long from college, and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page31" id="page31" title="31"></a>
the metaphysics and dogmatics of the schools were more to his mind
than the poetry and religion of this moorland child. If asked to
discourse on personality, or expound the latest phase of German
thought, he would have felt himself at home. Here, however, he who
was the idol of the class-room sat silenced and foolish before a
peasant girl. True, he could enter into an argument for a future
state, and show how spiritual laws opposed the mundane imagination
of the child. But, after all, wherein was the use?&mdash;perhaps the
child was nearer the truth than he was himself. He would leave her
to her own pristine fancies.</p>

<p>In a moment Milly continued:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Th' Bible says, Mr. Penrose, that i' heaven there's a
street paved wi' gowd (gold). Naa; I'd raither hev a meadow wi'
posies, or th' moors when they're covered wi' yethbobs. If heaven's
baan to be all streets, I'd as soon stop o' this side&mdash;though
they be paved wi' gowd an' o'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Listen yo', how hoo talks, Mr. Penrose. Hoo's awlus talked
i' that feshion sin' hoo were a little un. Aar owd minister used to
co her &ldquo;God's child.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page32" id="page32" title="32"></a>
<p>Mr. Penrose was a young man, and thought that &lsquo;Nature's
child&rsquo; would be, perhaps, a more fitting name, but held his
thought unuttered. Wishing Milly and her mother a
&lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; he descended the old stone staircase to
the kitchen, where Abraham Lord sat smoking and looking gloomily
into the embers of the fire.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Has th' missus towd thee ought abaat aar Milly?&rsquo;
somewhat sullenly interrogated the father.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing of any moment,&rsquo; said Mr. Penrose. &lsquo;Of
course she could not; we were never together out of your daughter's
presence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then aw'll tell thee. Milly's baan to-morn to th'
infirmary to hev her leg tan off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The strong man shook in the convulsive grip of his grief. No
tears came to his relief; the storm was deep down in his soul;
outlet there was none.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mr. Penrose,&rsquo; said he, laying a hand on the
minister's shoulder; &lsquo;Mr. Penrose, if I'd ha' known afore I
were wed that gettin' wed meant a child o' mine being tan fro' me
and cut i' pieces by them doctor chaps, I'd never ha' wed,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page33" id="page33" title="33"></a>
fond o' Martha as I wor and am.  No, Mr. Penrose, I never would.
They might tak' me, and do what they'n a mind wi' me, at their
butcherin' shops. But her&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Here the strong man was swept by another convulsive storm of
feeling too deep for utterance. Subduing his passion by a supreme
effort of will, he continued:</p>

<p>&lsquo;However, them as knows best says as it's her only chance,
and I'm noan goin' agen it. I shall go daan wi' her mysel'
to-morn.&rsquo;</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>Milly, or &lsquo;th' little lass o' Lord's,&rsquo; as the
villagers called her, was one of those phenomenal child
personalities which now and again visit this world as though to defy
all laws of heredity, and remind the selfish and the mighty of that
kingdom in which the little one is ruler. A bright, bonny,
light-haired girl&mdash;the vital feelings of delight pulsed through
all her being. Born amid the moorlands, cradled in the heather,
nourished on the breezy heights of Rehoboth, she grew up an ideal
child of the hills. For years her morning baptism had been a frolic
across the dewy uplands; and, evening
<a class="pagebreak" name="page34" id="page34" title="34"></a>
by evening, the light of setting suns kindled holy fires in her
rapturous and wonder-filled eyes. The native heart, too, was in
touch with the native heath; for Milly's nature was deeply poetic,
many of her questions betraying a disposition and sympathy strangely
out of harmony with the kindly, yet rude, stock from which she
sprang. From a toddling child her eye carried sunshine and her
presence peace. Unconsciously she leavened the whole village, and
toned much of the harsh Calvinism that knit together its iron creed.
There was not one who did not in some way respond to the magic of
her voice, her mood, her presence. Even Joseph softened as she stood
by the yawning graves which he was digging, and questioned him as to
the dying and the dead. The old pastor, Mr. Morell, stern man that
he was, used to put his hand on her head, and call her his
&lsquo;Goldilocks&rsquo;; and he had once been heard to say, after
leaving her, &lsquo;And a little child shall lead them.&rsquo;
Though somewhat lonely, there was neither priggishness nor precocity
in her disposition; she was just herself&mdash;unspoiled from the
hands of God and of Nature.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page35" id="page35" title="35"></a>
<p>Shortly after her twelfth birthday she was caught on the moors by
a heavy autumnal shower, and, unwilling to miss her ramble by
returning home, pursued her way drenched to the skin. A severe
illness was the consequence, an illness which left a weakness in her
knee, eventually incapacitating her for all exercise whatever, and
keeping her a prisoner to the house. The village doctor laboured
long, but in vain was all his skill. At last a specialist from the
great city beyond the hills was called, who ordered the child to be
removed to the Royal Infirmary, where care, skill, and nourishment
would all be within easy reach. So it came to pass one summer
morning, as the sun lighted up the wide moors, and the hum of the
factories in the valley began to be carried upwards towards the
heights, a little crowd of folks gathered round the door of Abraham
Lord's cottage to take a farewell of &lsquo;th' little lass.&rsquo;
About eight o'clock the doctor drove up, and in a few moments Milly
was carried in his and her father's strong arms and gently laid in
the cushioned carriage, and then slowly driven away from the home
which now for the first
<a class="pagebreak" name="page36" id="page36" title="36"></a>
time in her life she was leaving.  The eyes of the onlookers were as
moist as the dewy herbage on which they stood, and many a voice
trembled in the farewell given in response to Milly's
&lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of that dark day Milly's mother never left
the cottage; and when her husband, weary and dispirited, returned at
nightfall, she could scarcely nerve herself to question him lest
some word of his should add another stab to her already sorely
wounded heart. When ten o'clock struck, and Abraham Lord laid his
hand on the key to shoot the lock for the night, he burst into
tears, and turning to his wife, said: &lsquo;Never, my lass, wi'
Milly on th' wrong side&rsquo;; and for months the parents slept
with an unbarred door.</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>&lsquo;You have a remarkable patient in Milly Lord,&rsquo; said
Dr. Franks to Nurse West one morning.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have indeed, doctor. I never met with another like her
in all my seven years' experience.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Does she talk much?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page37" id="page37" title="37"></a>
<p>&lsquo;At times. But I should call her a silent child; at least,
she does not talk like other children. When she does talk it is to
make some quaint remark, or to ask some strange question.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;she's just asked me
one. I referred her to you and the chaplain. Religion, you know, is
not much in my line.  But for all that, I must own it was a
perplexing question.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Might I ask what it was, doctor?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! she asked if I thought Jesus was sent here to suffer
pain in order that God might find out what pain was; and if so, was
it not queer that God should allow so much pain to exist. There now,
nurse, you have a problem. By the way, do you think the child knows
the limb has to be amputated?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She has guessed as much, doctor.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Does she seem to fear the operation?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not at all. She talks as though it had to be. Do you think
it will be successful?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Franks shrugged his shoulders, uttering no word by way of
reply.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I should not like Milly to slip from us,&rsquo; continued
the nurse.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page38" id="page38" title="38"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Nor should I. We'll keep her if we can, and if she'll only
help us with a good heart we may possibly manage to pull her
through.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And with a mirthless laugh the doctor turned on his heel,
removing, when unobserved, his spectacles and wiping the moisture
from them and from his eyes.</p>

<p>From the day that Milly entered the great infirmary, the charm of
her childhood laid its spell upon all who came near her. Not only
was the gloomy ward brighter for her presence, but patients and
nurses were infected with her strange personality and undefinable
influence. Even the doctors lingered a moment longer at her bedside,
looking pensively into the light of those eyes whose fires had been
kindled under sunny skies, and at the beauty of that face, kissed
into loveliness by the wandering winds that played around Rehoboth
heights.</p>

<p>At last the morning of the operation came, and Milly was wheeled
into the theatre, where a crew of noisy students were joking and
indulging in the frolics which, from time immemorial, have been the
privilege of their order. As soon, however, as they caught sight of
the child every
<a class="pagebreak" name="page39" id="page39" title="39"></a>
voice was hushed, and quietness prevailed, for not a few already
knew something of her winsomeness and beauty. As she was placed on
the operating-table the sunlight fell through the lanthorn, and
lighted up the golden clusters of her hair, the welcome rays calling
forth from her now pale features a responsive smile. In another
minute she lay peaceful and motionless under the anæsthetic&mdash;a
statue, immobile, yet expressionful, as though carved by some master
hand.</p>

<p>A burly-looking surgeon, with the sleeves of his operating coat
neatly turned up, approached the table on which Milly was stretched,
and in a business-like manner set about his task.  Carefully
handling one of his cold and glittering instruments, he paused; then
bending himself over the patient, appeared as though about to make
the first incision, yet hesitated.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is the matter with old Rogers?&rsquo; asked the
students, under their breath; and one or two of the doctors looked
knowingly at each other.</p>

<p>There was nothing the matter, however, with old Rogers for long.
He merely muttered
<a class="pagebreak" name="page40" id="page40" title="40"></a>
something about it being a shame to cut into such flesh as Milly's,
and proceeded to go calmly through his work, like the old hand that
he was.</p>

<p>The operation was successful, and yet Milly seemed to make no
satisfactory progress. The old flow of life returned not, and a
settled gloom rested over her once merry heart. She was as one
suffering from an indefinable hunger; even she herself knew not what
it was she wanted. Unremitting was the attention shown, nurses and
doctors alike doing their utmost, even to works of supererogation,
on her behalf. Week by week her parents visited her, while there was
not a patient in the ward who would not have sacrificed a half of
her own chances of recovery, if by so doing she could have ensured
hers. All, however, seemed in vain; rally she could not. The ward
oppressed her, and the gloomy autumn clouds that hung over the
wilderness of warehouses upon which her eye rested day by day
canopied her with despair. She listened for the wind&mdash;but all
she heard was its monotonous hum along the telegraph wires that
stretched overhead. She looked for
<a class="pagebreak" name="page41" id="page41" title="41"></a> the
birds&mdash;but all she saw was the sooty-winged house-sparrow that
perched upon the eaves. She longed for the stars&mdash;but the
little area of sky that grudgingly spared itself for her gaze was
oftener clouded than clear as the night hour drew on. The truth was,
she was pining for her native heath; but she knew it not, nor did
her kindly ministrants.</p>

<p>In the next bed to Milly's lay a young woman slowly dying of an
internal malady, whose home, too, was far away among the moors, and
whose husband came week by week to visit her. On one of these visits
he brought with him a bunch of flowers&mdash;for the most part made
up of the &lsquo;wildings of Nature&rsquo;&mdash;among which was a
tuft of heather in all the glory of its autumnal bloom. Turning
towards the sick child, the poor woman reached out her wasted arm,
and throwing a spray on to Milly's counterpane, said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here, lass, I'll gi' thee that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In a moment Milly's eyes flashed light, and the bloom of the
moorland flower reflected itself in the blush of her cheeks.
Throwing up both hands, and wild with a tide of new life, she
cried:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page42" id="page42" title="42"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Nurse! nurse! Sithee&mdash;a yethbob&mdash;a
yethbob!&rsquo;</p>

<p>From that hour commenced Milly's convalescence. What medicine and
nursing failed to accomplish was carried to a successful issue by
&lsquo;a tuft of heather.&rsquo; For Milly did not die&mdash;indeed,
she still lives; and although unable to roam and romp the moors that
lie in great sweeps around her cottage home, she sits and looks at
&lsquo;th' angels' een&rsquo;&mdash;as she still calls the
stars&mdash;believing that in those heavenly watchers are the eyes
that slumber not, nor sleep.</p>

<h3>III.</h3><h3>OWD ENOCH'S FLUTE.</h3>

<p>It was a sunny afternoon in June, and old Enoch, sitting in the
shade of the garden bushes, called forth sweet tones from his flute.
No score was before him; that from which he played was scored on his
heart. Being in that sweet mood when</p>
<blockquote class="inline">
<span class="i6">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                             &lsquo;Pleasant thoughts</span><br />
<span class="i0">Bring sad thoughts to the mind,&rsquo;</span>
</blockquote>
<p>he was living over again, in the melodies that he played, his
chequered past. Forms moved before him to the music, and faces,
long since dust, smiled at him, and held converse with him, as the
plaintive notes rose and fell and died away. Winds, sweetened by
their sweep over miles of ling and herbage, and spiced with the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page44" id="page44" title="44"></a>
scents of the garden-flowers that like a zone of colour encircled
him, kissed his lips, and stole therefrom his melodies, bearing them
onwards to the haunts of the wild fowl, or letting them fall where
brooklets from the hills sang their silvery songs. Along the path by
which he sat, all fringed with London-pride, the leaves spread
dappled shadows&mdash;a mosaic of nature fit for the tread of angels
or the dance of fairy sprites. Beyond the fence that fringed the
little cottage rolled great waves of upland, shimmering in the heat
of the midsummer glare&mdash;that hot breathing of the earth when
wooed too fiercely by her wanton paramour, the sun&mdash;while the
horizon discovered lines of dreamy sweep all crowned with haze, the
vestibules to other hills grander and more distant.</p>

<p>As the afternoon passed its golden hours, it passed them in
companionship with the notes of old Enoch's flute. Oblivious to the
time, oblivious to the surroundings, the musician heard not an
approaching step, nor knew that a listener stood behind the garden
bushes, with ear responsive to his melodies. How long he would have
played, how long his listener would
<a class="pagebreak" name="page45" id="page45" title="45"></a>
have remained undiscovered, it is hard to say&mdash;perhaps until
the dews fell and the stars glimmered. This was not to be, however,
for forth from the cottage door came his wife, who, with voice
drowning the strain of the flute, cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Enoch, owd lad! dun yo' see th' parson?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ah, heedless Enoch! What was parson, what was wife to him? Was he
not soaring far above theologies and domesticities, over continents
traversed only by memory, amid ideals seen only with the eye of
hope? But a woman's voice!&mdash;what is there it cannot shatter and
dispel?</p>

<p>&lsquo;Enoch! Enoch! dun yo' yer? Doesto see th'
parson?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, lass, I doan't,&rsquo; said he, taking the flute from
his lips.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I welly think he's forgetten us this time,
Enoch.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nod he, lass; he's too fond o' thi butter-cakes and
moufins (muffins) to forgeet. He's some fond o' thi bakin', I con
tell thaa. Didn't he say as when he geet wed he'd bring his missis
to thee to larn haa to mak' bread?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page46" id="page46" title="46"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Yi, he did, for sure!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And so he will,&rsquo; said Mr. Penrose, stepping from
behind the garden bush. &lsquo;You see your husband is right, Mrs.
Ashworth. I've not forgotten it is baking-day, or that I was due at
your house to tea.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Theyer, Enoch, thaa sees what thi tootling on th' owd
flute's done for thee,&rsquo; said the old woman, in her surprise
and chagrin.  &lsquo;Thaa cornd be too careful haa thaa talks. Thaa
sees trees hes yers as weel as stoan walls.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ne'er mind, Mr. Penrose; I were nobbud hevin' her on a
bit. Hoo thinks a mighty lot o' parsons, I con tell yo'. Hoo's never
reet but when hoo's oather listenin' to 'em or feedin' 'em,&rsquo;
and the old man quietly broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' dun yo' know what he sez abaat parsons, Mr. Penrose? I
mud as weel tell tales abaat him naa he's started tellin' tales
abaat me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose declared he had no idea what old Enoch's criticisms
on the members of the cloth were, but expressed a strong desire to
be made familiar with them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Weel,&rsquo; continued Mrs. Ashworth, &lsquo;he sez
<a class="pagebreak" name="page47" id="page47" title="47"></a>
as he never noather flatters parsons nor women, for noather on 'em
con ston' it. Naa, then, what dun yo' mak' o' that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He's very wise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What saysto?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I only mean as far as the parsons are concerned. As to
women&mdash;why, I suppose I must be silent.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ne'er mind, Mr. Penrose; tay's waitin', so come along. Yo'
cornd bridle women folks, and it's happen as weel yo' cornd; for if
they mutn't talk they'd scrat, and that 'ud be a deal
wur.&rsquo;</p>

<p>During tea Mr. Penrose apologized for hiding behind the bushes in
the garden while old Enoch was playing the flute: &lsquo;But,&rsquo;
continued he, &lsquo;the airs were so sweet that it would have been
a sin to mar them by interruption.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Upon hearing this Enoch's eye brightened, and a flush of pride
mantled on his cheek. These signs were at once detected by his
quick-eyed wife, who broke out in a triumphant voice:</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' that's him as wouldn't flatter parsons an' women,
cose, as he sez, they cornd ston' it;
<a class="pagebreak" name="page48" id="page48" title="48"></a>
and he's aside hissel cose yo've cracked up his playin', Mr.
Penrose.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All reet, owd lass,&rsquo; good-humouredly retorted Enoch,
looking love through his mild blue eyes at his wife, who knew so
well how to defend her own, &lsquo;all reet; but if thaa durnd mind
I'll tell Mr.  Penrose abaat Dickey o' Wams.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' I'll tell him abaat Edge End &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo;
and thi marlock wi' th' owd piccolo.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Supposing I hear both stories,&rsquo; said the minister.
&lsquo;Then I can apply both, and judge between you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! there's nowt in 'em,&rsquo; replied Enoch.
&lsquo;Sometimes, thaa knows, when hoo's a bit fratchy, I plague her
wi' tellin' o' Dickey o' Wams, who wor talkin' abaat his wife's
tantrums, when his maisther stopped him and said, &ldquo;Dickey,
wherever did ta pike her up?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Oh, 'mang a
lot more lumber up Stackkirk way.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>As this story was told with all the dry humour of which Enoch
possessed so large a share, both the old woman and Mr. Penrose
crowned it with a hearty laugh, the minister turning to his hostess
and saying:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page49" id="page49" title="49"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Mrs. Ashworth, it's your turn. What about the Edge
End &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mun I tell him, Enoch?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, owd lass; id 'll pleeas thee, and noan hurt me. Brast
(start) off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, yo' mun know, Mr. Penrose, they were givin' th'
&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; at Edge End. Eh! dear, Enoch,&rsquo; sighed
the old woman, stopping short in her story, &lsquo;it's thirty year
sin' come next Kesmas.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lass, it is. There's some snow fallen sin'
then.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There hes that, an' we've bed our share and o'. But, as I
wor tellin' yo', Mr. Penrose, they wor givin' th'
&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; at Edge End, and bed just getten to &ldquo;How
beautiful are th' feet.&rdquo; Naa, it wor arranged that aar Enoch
mud play th' piccolo accompaniment, and he started fairly weel.
Happen he wor a bit flat, for th' chapel wor very hot, an' most o'
th' instruments aat o' pitch.  But, as I say, he started fairly
weel, when th' conductor, a chap fra Manchester, who thought he knew
summat, said, &ldquo;Hooisht, hooisht!&rdquo; But th' owd lad stuck
to his tune. Then th' conductor banged his stick on th' <a
class="pagebreak" name="page50" id="page50" title="50"></a> music,
and, wi' a face as red as a soudger's coite (soldier's coat), called
aat agen, &ldquo;Hooisht!  Doesto yer?&mdash;hooisht!&rdquo; But
he'd mistaan his mon, Mr. Penrose, for Enoch nobbud stopped short to
say, &ldquo;Thee go on with thi conductin'. If hoo'll sing I'll
play.&rdquo; And hoo did sing an' o'.  An' Enoch welly blew his lips
off wi' playin', I con tell thi.  But, somehaa or other, hoo never
cared to come and sing i' these parts after, and they never geet
Enoch to tak' th' piccolo accompaniment agen to &ldquo;How beautiful
are th' feet.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, an' they never will. I somehaa think I had summat to
do wi' spoilin' th' beauty of &ldquo;their feet&rdquo; that neet,
Mr. Penrose, though I've played in mony a oratory (oratorio) sin'
then, an' mean to do agen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After tea Enoch took Mr. Penrose for a stroll over the moors. The
sun was westering, and cool airs crept up from distant wilds,
playing softly as they swept among the long grasses, and leading
Enoch to say to Mr. Penrose, &lsquo;Theer's music for yo'.&rsquo;
The great hills threw miles of shadow, and masses of fleecy clouds
slowly crossed the deepening blue like white galleons
<a class="pagebreak" name="page51" id="page51" title="51"></a>
on a sapphire sea.  Along the crests of the far-off hills mystic
colours were mingling, deepening, and fading away&mdash;the
tremulous drapery woven by angel hands, behind which the bridegroom
of day was hiding his splendour and his strength. Soft herbage
yielded to the tread, and warm stretches of peaty soil lay like bars
across the green and gray and gold of what seemed to Mr. Penrose the
shoreless waste of moor. On distant hills stood lone farmsteads,
their little windows glowing with the lingering beams of the setting
sun; the low of kine, the bay of dog, and the shout of shepherd,
softened into sweetest sounds as they travelled from far along the
wings of the evening wind. It was the hour when Nature rests, and
when man meditates&mdash;if the soul of meditation be his.</p>

<p>After a silence of some minutes Enoch turned to Mr. Penrose and
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Jokin' aside, Mr. Penrose, that owd flute yo' yerd me
playin' this afternoon is a part o' my life. Let's sit daan i' this
nook and I'll tell yo' all abaat it. Three times in mi history it's
bin mi salvation. Th' first wor when I lost mi brass. We lived daan
at th' Brig then, and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page52" id="page52" title="52"></a>
I ran th' factory. I wor thirty-five year owd, and hed a tidy bit o'
brass, when they geet me to put a twothree hunderd in a speculation.
Ay, dear! I wor fool enugh not to let weel alone. I did as they
wanted me. Me, and Bill Stott's faither, and owd Jerry o' th' Moss
went in together heavy, and we lost every farthin'. I shall never
forgeet it. It wor Sunday mornin' when th' news coome fro' th'
lawyer. I wor i' bed when th' missis gav me th' letter, and I could
tell by her face summat wor wrang.  &ldquo;What is it, lass?&rdquo;
I axed. &ldquo;What a towd thee it would be,&rdquo; hoo said.
&ldquo;We are ruined.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thaa never sez so!&rdquo; I
shaated. &ldquo;It's paper as says so,&rdquo; hoo said, &ldquo;noan
me,&rdquo; and hoo handed me th' lawyer's letter. I tried to get aat
o' bed, Mr. Penrose, but when I set mi feet on th' floor, I couldn't
ston'. &ldquo;I've lost my legs, missis,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Nay,
lad, thank God, thaa's getten thi legs yet; it's thi brass thaa's
lost!&rdquo; I shall never forgeet those days. Then came th' sale,
and th' flittin', an' all th' black looks. Yo' know yor friends when
th' brass goes, Mr. Penrose. Poverty's a rare hond for pikin' aat
hypocrites. It maks no mistakes; it
<a class="pagebreak" name="page53" id="page53" title="53"></a>
tells yo' who's who. We'd scarce a friend i' those days. I wor weeks
and never held up mi yed, and noabry but th' missis to speak to.
Then it wor th' owd flute coome to mi help. I'd nobbud to tak' it
up, and put it to mi lips, and it ud begin to speyk. Yi, an' it
cried an' o', and took my sorrow on itsel, and shifted it away fro'
me.  I've played o' th' neet thro' on these moors, Mr. Penrose, when
I couldn't sleep i' bed, or stay i' th' haas. It's a grond thing, is
music, when yo're brokken-hearted. If ever yo' marry and hev
childer, teach 'em music&mdash;a chap as con play con feight th'
devil so much better nor him as cornd.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Old Enoch took his cap from his head, and wiped his brow, and
continued:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Th' flute were my salvation agen, Mr. Penrose, when our
lad deed.  He wor just one-and-twenty, and he's bin dead eighteen
year. Brass is nothin' when it comes to berryin' yor own, Mr.
Penrose. Poverty may touch a mon's pride, but death touches his
heart. When yo' see yor own go aat o' th' haas feet fermost, and yo'
know it's for good an' o', there's summat taan aat o' yo' that
nothin' ever
<a class="pagebreak" name="page54" id="page54" title="54"></a> maks
up for at afterwards. I wor a long time afore I forgave th' Almeety
for takin' aar Joe. And all the time I owed Him a grudge, and kep'
on blamin' Him like; I got wurr and wurr, until I welly went mad.
Then I coome across th' old flute, and it seemed to say, &ldquo;I'll
help thee agen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay, owd brid,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;tha cornd. It's noan brass this time, it's mi lad.&rdquo; And
th' owd flute seemed to say, &ldquo;Try me.&rdquo; So I tuk it up,
and put it to mi lips and blew&mdash;yi, aat of a sad heart, Mr.
Penrose&mdash;but it wor reet. Th' owd flute gi' me back mi
prayer&mdash;grace for grace, as yo' parsons say, whatever yo' mean
by't. And as I sat on th' bench i' th' garden&mdash;same bench as
yo' saw me sittin' on this afternoon&mdash;my missis coome to th'
dur, and hoo said, &ldquo;Enoch, what doesto think?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nay, lass,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I durnd know.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; hoo says, &ldquo;I think as thaa's fotched aar
Joe daan fro' heaven to hear thee playin'; he seems nearer to me naa
nor he ever did sin' he left us.&rdquo; And so, ever afterwards, Mr.
Penrose, when we want to feel aar Joe near us, I just taks up th'
flute and plays, and he awlus comes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Old Enoch paused, for his voice was thick,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page55" id="page55" title="55"></a>
and with his handkerchief he wiped away the moisture from his
eyes.</p>

<p>In another minute he continued:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bud, Mr. Penrose, I'd a wurr trouble than oather o' those
I've towd yo' on. A twothree year sin' I wor a reprobate. I don't
know how it coom abaat, but somehaa I geet fond o' drink, and I tuk
to stopping aat late, and comin' wom' rough like, and turnin' agen
th' missus. They coom up to see me from Rehoboth, and owd Mr.
Morell prayed wi' me; but it wor all no use. Th' devil hissel wor in
me. They say, Mr. Penrose, as yo' durnd believe in a devil; that yo'
co evil a principle or summat of that sort. If thaa'd bin like me
thaa'd hev no doubts abaat a devil. I've felt him in me, an' I've
felt him tak' howd o' me and do as he'd a mind wi' me.  One day,
when they'd crossed mi name off th' Rehoboth register, and th'
missus were sobbin' fit to break her heart, aw coom across th' owd
flute as aw were rootin' in a box for some medicine. There it lay,
long forgetten. As aw seed it, tears coom in my een. Aw thought haa
it bed helped mi when I lost o' mi brass, and when Joe deed, and aw
tuk it up and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page56" id="page56" title="56"></a>
said, &ldquo;Can ta help me naa, thinksto?&rdquo; An' aw put it
together, and went aat on th' moors and began to play; and fro' that
hour to this aw've never wanted to sup a drop o' drink. Naa, Mr.
Penrose, yo' preachers talk abaat th' Cross, and it's o' reet that
yo' should; but yo' cannot blame me for talkin' abaat my flute, con
yo', when it's bin my salvation? And whenever awm a bit daanhearted,
or hardhearted, or fratchy wi' th' missus, or plaguey wi' fo'k, aw
goes to th' owd flute, and it helps me o'er th' stile. But it's
gettin' lat'; let's be goin' wom'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Arriving at the cottage, Enoch told his wife how he had given Mr.
Penrose the history of his old flute, whereupon the good woman wept
and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Him and me, Mr. Penrose, has many a time supped sorrow,
but th' owd flute has awlus sweetened aar cup, hesn't it,
Enoch?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lass, it awlus hes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That night, before Mr. Penrose left the moorland cottage of the
Ashworths, old Enoch took up the flute tenderly, and, with a far-off
look in his eyes, commenced to play a plaintive air, which the old
woman told Mr.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page57" id="page57" title="57"></a>
Penrose was to &lsquo;their Joe,&rsquo; who was &lsquo;up aboon wi'
Jesus.&rsquo; And as the minister descended the brow towards his own
home, the sweet, sad music continued to fall in dying strains upon
his ears; and that night, and many a night afterwards, did he vex
his brain to find out why redemption should be wrought out by a
flute, when the creed of Rehoboth was powerless.</p>

<h3>I.</h3><h3>THE UTTERMOST FARTHING.</h3>

<p>&lsquo;Well! yo' and Jim may do as yo' like&mdash;but I'm noan
baan to turn aat o' th' owd Fold till I'm ta'en aat feet
fermost.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, gronny&mdash;don't tak' on so. Yo' cornd ston' agen
law as haa it be; a writ is a writ, and if yo' hevn't got brass it's
no use feightin'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A, lass! I'm feared thaa's reet&mdash;naa-a-days them as
has most gets most, and their own way i' th' bargain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They were sitting over the hearth, the elder woman gazing wearily
into the dying embers of the fire, and nursing her chin on her hand;
while the younger, with her clog upon the rocker of a deal cradle,
gave to that ark of infancy the gentle and monotonous movement
<a class="pagebreak" name="page62" id="page62" title="62"></a>
which from time immemorial has soothed the restlessness of
child-life.</p>

<p>It was a pitiless night&mdash;a night the superstitious might
well associate with the portent of the downfall of the house around
which the storm seemed to rage. The rain beat upon the windows, and
the wind with its invisible arms clasped the old farmstead as if to
wrench it from its foundations and scatter broadcast its gray stones
over the wild moor on the fringe of which it stood.  Neither of the
women, however, heeded the sweep of the tempest, for their bosoms
were racked by storms other than those of the elements. With eyes
heavy from pent-up floods of tears, and hearts dark with foreboding,
they listened for the footfall which both knew would bring with it
their impending fate.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He's here,&rsquo; said the old woman, quickly raising her
head during one of the lulls of the storm. Nor was she mistaken, for
in a moment the door was thrown open by a tall broad-shouldered man,
who, seizing the dripping cap from his head, flung it with an oath
into the farthest corner of the room.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then he'll noan give us another chonce, lad?
<a class="pagebreak" name="page63" id="page63" title="63"></a>
But thaa cornd mend it wi' swearin'&mdash;thaa nobbud makes bad
worse by adding thy oaths to his roguery.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oaths, mother! Oaths didsto say? I can tell thee th'
Almighty sometimes thinks more o' oaths than prayers. Owd Moses'll
say his to-neet&mdash;but my oaths'll get to heaven
faster.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hooisht, Jim! hooisht! ne'er mind Moses and his prayers.
What did he say about th' mortgage?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Say! why he said he'd oather hev his brass at ten o'clock
to-morn, or skift us wi' law. And he'll do it&mdash;that he
will.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A, lad&mdash;thaa says truth. Owd Moses'll keep his word;
he never lies when he threatens poor fo'k like us. But I never
thought it ud come to this. I could ha' liked to ha' deed in th' owd
chamber aboon, and left th' haas feet fermost when I left it for
good.&rsquo; And the old woman rocked herself in her grief over the
dying fire.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, gronmother, wee'n all to dee, and I durnd know as it
matters where we dee as long as we're ready. It's where we're baan
to live as
<a class="pagebreak" name="page64" id="page64" title="64"></a>
bothers me,&rsquo; said the hard-headed daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I've lived my life, thaa sees, lass. I'm nobbud waitin' to
go to them as is gone afore; and I could ha' liked to foller them
from th' owd haas. And then thaa'rt noan o' th' owd stock, lass. Thy
folks ne'er rooted theirsels i' th' soil like mine. It's fifty year
come next Whisundy (Whitsuntide) since Jimmie's faither brought me
here; and as I come in by wedlock, I could ha' liked to ha' gone out
by berryin'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come, mother,&rsquo; said the now subdued son,
&lsquo;we'll find a home for thee, and when thaa dees we'll put thee
away. Durnd tak' on like that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the old woman heeded not the kindly words of her son. Her
thoughts were in the past, and she was reliving the years that were
gone. Gazing into the expiring embers, she saw the forms of long
ago; and talking first to herself, and then to her son and his wife,
she continued, in a crooning voice:</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's fifty year come next Whisundy sin thi faither brought
me here, lad&mdash;fifty year, and it only seems like yesterday. We
were wed at th' owd church i' Manchester. Dan o' Nodlocks,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page65" id="page65" title="65"></a>
as used to live up at th' Chapel-hill, drove us there and back in
his new spring-cart; and what wi' gettin' there and being spliced,
and comin' wom' we were all th' day at th' job. Th' sun were just
showin' hissel o'er th' hill yonder when we started, and it were
goin' daan o'er th' moors when we geet back; and thi faither, Jimmy,
as he lifted me daan from th' cart and put me in th' porch yonder,
kissed me and said: &ldquo;Sunshine aatside, Jenny, and sunshine
in.&rdquo; An' that's fifty year ago, lad, and I've never slept out
o' th' owd haas from that neet to this, and I durnd want to leave it
naa.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, durnd tak' on like that, mother; if tha' does
thaa'll break my heart. We shall happen stop yet, who knows?&rsquo;
and Jim almost choked with the lie which he told in his wild anguish
to stay the torrent of his mother's grief.</p>

<p>But the crooning old woman heeded him not. With eyes fixed on the
fire she continued to read the horoscope of the past:</p>

<p>&lsquo;We were some happy, those first years, I can tell thee.
Then little Billy wor born. Poor little Billy! Thaa's been a good
lad, Jim, but
<a class="pagebreak" name="page66" id="page66" title="66"></a>
I often think what a good un little Billy would ha' been if he'd
lived! But he deed. Ay! I con remember it as though it were nobbud
yesterneet. It was abaat th' deead hour, and I wakened up
sudden-like, for summat towd me all were not reet wi' th' lad.  I
made thi faither strike a leet, and then I see'd Billy's een were
set, and his little mouth twitchin'. Thi faither run off, half
dressed as he were, for th' doctor. But it wor no use; Billy were
going cowd in my arms when they both geet back. And then they laid
th' little lad aat in th' owd chamber, and I used to creep upstairs
when thi faither were in th' meadow, and talk to Billy, and ax him
to oppen his een. But it wor all no use, he never glent at me agen.
I never cried, lad&mdash;I couldn't. I felt summat wor taan aat o'
me,&rsquo; and the old woman laid her hand on her heart. &lsquo;I
was empty-like; and then five years after, as I lay in bed in th'
owd chamber aboon&mdash;same chamber as Billy were laid out
in&mdash;Mary o' Sams, who had come to nurse me, said: &ldquo;Thou
mun look up, Jenny, it's another lad,&rdquo; and she put thee in my
arms, and then th' warkin' went, and I were a happy woman again. I
could ha'
<a class="pagebreak" name="page67" id="page67" title="67"></a>
liked to ha' kept little Billy, but Him aboon knows best: thaa's bin
a good lad to me, Jimmy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tears began to stream from the eyes of Jimmy's wife; and stooping
down, she lifted her sleeping baby from its cradle, and hugged it to
her breast. The story of little Billy had, for the moment, softened
the heart of this practical and common-sense woman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That's reet, lass. Keep him close to thee, he'll need thee
and thaa'll need him afore yo're both done wi' th' world. Since thi
faither deed, Jimmy, I've felt to need thee more and more. It's ten
year this last back-end sin' we buried him. And it's nobbud just
like yesterday. He wor in th' barn when he wor taan, sudden-like,
with apoplex; and he never spoke, or knew me or you at after. And he
wor laid aat in th' owd chamber, too, where they laid little Billy
aat afore him, and where yo' wor born, lad. I thought I should be
laid aat there, and all, and I could ha' liked it to be so. But I
mun be off to bed, childer, it's gettin' lat'.  I shall sleep in th'
owd chamber to-neet, wheresomever I sleep to-morn.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page68" id="page68" title="68"></a>
<p>And so saying, the grandmother took her lamp, and climbed the
worn stone staircase to her room&mdash;a staircase trodden so many
times in changing moods of joy and sorrow, and with feet now
gladsome and now weary with honest toil and household care.</p>

<br />

<p>When Jimmy and his wife were alone, and the sound of the old
woman's voice no longer fell upon their ears, they realized, as
never before, the anguish of their surroundings. They were spending
their last night in what to one had been a life-long home, and to
the other a shelter of happiness for ten years of married life. The
story was a sad one, and yet, alas! not uncommon. Crawshaw
Fold&mdash;the old farmstead&mdash;dated back two hundred years, and
from the time of its erection to the present, had known neither
owners nor occupiers save those of the sturdy yeoman family from
which it took its name. It had been the boast of the Crawshaws that
no alien ever lorded it beneath their roof, or sat as presiding
genius at their hearth. They were proud to tell how all the heirs of
Crawshaw Fold only entered its portals by the mystic gate
<a class="pagebreak" name="page69" id="page69" title="69"></a>
of birth, nor departed until summoned by the passing bell. But
families, like individuals, grow old, and with the course of years
the richest blood runs thin. Bad seasons, which are the friends of
the money-lender and mortgagee, are the foes of hereditary descent
and family pride, and many are the escutcheons erased and the lines
of lineage broken by reverses wrought through their fitful moods.
The Crawshaws were no exception. A succession of disasters on their
little farmstead brought them to sore straits, and for deliverance
they sought help of one Moses Fletcher, who advanced money on the
deeds of the property. So bad were the times that James Crawshaw was
unable to meet the interest, and on the morrow Moses was putting in
force his claim.  This was the shadow that fell across the
hearth&mdash;the despair that was seated like a hideous ghoul by
their fireside. In the morning three generations of Crawshaw would
be homeless.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, lad,&rsquo; said Jimmy's wife, &lsquo;it's no use
lying daan to dee afore one's time; there's this little un to fend
for, and, as I say, th' wick is o' more value than th' deeing. Th'
owd Book says
<a class="pagebreak" name="page70" id="page70" title="70"></a>
as th' deead is to bury th' deead, but I'm noan deead
yet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa'rt hard on th' owd woman, lass. It's nobbud natural
as hoo should want to lie daan and dee where all her folk has deed
afore her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, lad, I'm noan hard. Hoo'll go where we go, and we's
be doin' aar duty both to her and th' child here by workin' for 'em,
instead of frettin' and sobbin' as though all wor o'er.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Happen so; but thaa's more hope nor I hev. I durnd think
th' sun will ever shine again for us, lass.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Get away wi' thee! Th' sun 'll shine to-morn for them as
has een to see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Throughout this conversation the footfall of the old grandmother
was heard distinctly on the chamber floor above, for on reaching her
room she did not, as was her wont, seek at once the shelter of her
bed, but, placing the lamp on the table, commenced a fond and
farewell survey of the old chamber. Over the fireplace hung an old
sampler, worked by her deft fingers in girlhood's days&mdash;her
maiden name spelt out in now
<a class="pagebreak" name="page71" id="page71" title="71"></a>
faded silks, with a tree of paradise on either side and under it the
date of a forgotten year; while an old leather-cased Bible, in which
were inscribed the epochs of the family, lay open upon a chair.</p>

<p>Withdrawing her eyes from these, she slowly turned towards the
clothes-press, and, opening the oaken doors, looked at a suit of
black&mdash;&lsquo;the Sunday best&rsquo; of her dead husband, left
undisturbed since his sudden decease ten years before. Then, turning
to a box at the foot of the bed&mdash;that historic four-poster
whereon the twin messengers of birth and death had so often
waited&mdash;she knelt and raised the lid, looking into its secrets
by the feeble ray emitted from the lamp. What she saw therein we
care not to tell. Our pen shall not blur the bloom of that romance
and association which for her the years could not destroy. Enough
that this was her ark, within which were relics as precious as the
budding rod and pot of manna. She was low before her holy of
holies&mdash;face to face with a light which falls from the
inalienable shrine of every woman who has been wife and mother, who
has loved a husband and carried a child.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page72" id="page72" title="72"></a>
<p>By this time the storm was over, and the winds, lately so
tempestuous, were gathered together and slept. A strange
hush&mdash;a hush as of appeased nature&mdash;rested like a
benediction over the house. The moon sailed along a swiftly clearing
sky of blue, and shot its silver shafts through the great
cloud-bastions that still barriered the horizon, and lighted up the
chamber in which the old woman was kneeling before her shrine. It
was across these God sent His kindly messenger with noiseless tread
to bear her sore and sorrowing soul &lsquo;where the wicked cease
from troubling and the weary are at rest.&rsquo;</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>At an early hour the minions of Moses Fletcher, the money-lender,
were hovering round Crawshaw Fold, not daring, however, to enter
until the fateful hour of ten. Jimmy, with his wife, sat before an
untasted breakfast, wondering how it was his mother was so late in
coming downstairs; and when at half-past eight there was no sign of
her appearance, he sent his wife, with a strong feeling of
foreboding, to find out the reason of the delay. Slowly she climbed
the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page73" id="page73" title="73"></a>
stairs to awaken, as she supposed, the old woman for the last tragic
act of the drama. When she stood upon the threshold of the chamber,
however, she saw at a glance that a kindly hand had drawn the
curtain before the enactment of the fateful and final scene. Calling
her husband, he hurried to her side; and, together, they raised
Jenny from her kneeling posture before the old chest, and laid her
on the bed, thanking God that for her the worst had been
forestalled. Four days afterwards old Jenny was carried out of the
Fold, feet foremost; and, amid a falling shower of snow, was laid
away by the side of little Billy and the good man with whom, for
forty years, she had shared her life. As the mourners returned,
chilled by the winter's blast, sleek Moses Fletcher crossed their
path, an old woman flinging at him the words:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa's had th' uttermost farthin', but thaa's God to
square wi' yet.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page74" id="page74" title="74"></a>
<a name="chapter2.2" id="chapter2.2"></a>
<h3>II.</h3><h3>THE REDEMPTION OF MOSES FLETCHER.</h3>

<p>Moses Fletcher was suffering from what the doctor called
&lsquo;nervous shock,&rsquo; with sundry wounds of a severe nature
received in an attempt to rescue his dog in a canine
<i>mêlée</i>.</p>

<p>He was a medium-sized man, with a hatchet face, lit by keen gray
eyes, small as a ferret's; and, by way of apology for a mouth,
displayed a thin lip-line which fell at either end with a cruel and
cynical curve.</p>

<p>As he lay in bed, with a face as white as the counterpane which
covered him, he now and again extended his bandaged hand to the
favourite hound that rested on a plaid shawl at his feet, calling it
by endearing names, and welcoming its warm and faithful
caresses.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page75" id="page75" title="75"></a>
<p>The chamber was small, but cosy, with many evidences of comfort.
Trellised greenery looked in at him through the deep-splayed
windows, and tapped a welcome on the diamond panes. He had, however,
no ear for this salute. Nor did he eye with delight the flowering
geraniums that clustered so thickly in the pots filling the sills.
Nor did he even care for the great bars of sunlight that fell in
golden splendour across his bed, causing the old dog to wink, and
sneeze, and smile beneath their mellowing beams. No, these were
nothing to him; indeed, they never had been&mdash;he had lived for
years oblivious alike to tree and flower and sun.</p>

<p>On the walls of his bedroom hung a number of rude prints, chief
among which was a hideous representation of Jesus Christ driving the
money-changers out of the Temple&mdash;the man of gentleness being
represented as a stern, passionless Master, the strength of whose
person was thrown into a relentless face, and a mighty arm wielding
a massive whip. At this figure he often glanced, and now and again a
look of recognition seemed to steal over his features, as though the
essence of his religion was embodied
<a class="pagebreak" name="page76" id="page76" title="76"></a>
in that act&mdash;a gospel anodyne for a suffering soul.</p>

<p>By the side of his bed was a small table on which lay two books,
the one bound in morocco, the other in leather&mdash;a Bible and a
ledger&mdash;his sole literature during the weary hours of sickness,
and wittily denominated by his wife, &lsquo;the books of mercy and
of judgment.&rsquo; Indeed, she often told him that he knew &lsquo;a
deal more o' th' book o' judgment than he did o' t'other&rsquo;; and
it was even so.</p>

<p>Moses languidly took up his Bible. It was a veritable study in
black and white, many passages being underscored, and many remaining
as unsoiled as though seldom read. Indeed, the Gospels seldom had
been read, while the imprecatory Psalms and the latter part of the
Epistle to the Romans were greasy and stained with oft perusal. But
there was a more remarkable feature about the Bible than
this&mdash;its margin was filled with a number of pen-and-ink notes!
figures and calculations of money advanced and interest drawn and
due; his clever, sarcastic wife calling this his &lsquo;reference
Bible,&rsquo; and sometimes telling him he was &lsquo;mighty i' th'
<a class="pagebreak" name="page77" id="page77" title="77"></a>
Scriptures&rsquo; when his own interest was concerned.</p>

<p>He laid down the Bible and took up his ledger. Ah! how he knew
that book!&mdash;to him actually and literally a book of life. He
knew its every page, and every name that headed those pages. True,
Moses knew the generations of the patriarchs, the names of the sons
of Jacob, the chronologies of the Chronicles, but he knew the
families of Rehoboth better. These latter were engraved on the palms
of his hands, and written with corroding ink on the fleshly tables
of his heart. As he turned over the well-thumbed pages he made many
mental calculations, sometimes smiling and sometimes sighing as his
eye fell on an irreclaimable debt. Then, taking up his pencil, he
entered an account on the fly-sheet of the Bible, and seemed
satisfied when he discovered that his illness would not involve him
in the loss which he had anticipated; and smiling the smile of
selfish gain, he closed his eyes and slept.</p>

<p>Poor Moses Fletcher! For with all his riches he was poor&mdash;if
being a pauper in the sight of Heaven is to be poor. How he had
<a class="pagebreak" name="page78" id="page78" title="78"></a>
lived to make money, and, having made it, how terrible was the cost!
Old Mr. Morell once told him that the angels reversed his balance
year by year, writing in invisible ink against his material profits
his moral and spiritual depreciation. And yet there was one
redeeming feature in the character of Moses&mdash;he loved his dog.
&lsquo;Captain,&rsquo; as the brute was called, kept one spot warm
in his callous nature, a little patch of vegetation on the bare
surface of his granite heart. The only noble acts in the life of
Moses Fletcher were acts wrought on behalf of this dog. Years ago he
risked his life to save it, when, as a whelp, mischievous boys
sought to drown it in the Green Fold Lodge; and only a week or two
ago he rescued it from the infuriated grip of a bull-terrier, at the
expense of injuries from which he was now slowly recovering.
Wherever Moses went he was followed by his dog; and if the dog was
seen alone it was known Moses was not far distant. Now, this dog had
to suffer for Moses' sins. It was, as Mr. Penrose used to say,
&lsquo;a vicarious dog&rsquo;&mdash;the innocent bearing the sins of
the guilty. Affectionate, faithful, gentle, with
<a class="pagebreak" name="page79" id="page79" title="79"></a>
no spice of viciousness in its nature, it was none the less stoned
by children and tormented by man and woman alike. One of Moses'
debtors, a stalwart quarryman, once took it on the moors and sent it
home with a spray of prickly holly tied under its tail. On another
occasion, an Irish labourer, whom Moses put in the County Court,
hurled a handful of quicklime in its eye, by which its sight had
been in part destroyed; and its glossy skin was all patched with
bare spots where outraged housewives had doused it with scalding
water.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We cornd get at <i>him</i>,&rsquo; they used to say,
&lsquo;but we con get at his dog, and mak' him smart i' that
road.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The last outrage, however, was by far the most brutal, and it
came about in this manner. It was County Court day at a small market
town over the hills, and Moses, accompanied by his dog, went with
his summonses. One of these was served against a man known as
&lsquo;Oliver o' Deaf Martha's&rsquo;&mdash;himself the owner of the
most belligerent dog in the neighbourhood&mdash;who, like Moses,
never moved without his canine friend. When his summons was heard
<a class="pagebreak" name="page80" id="page80" title="80"></a>
judgment went against him, and he was ordered to pay ten shillings a
month until the debt was wiped off. At this he uttered a curse,
muttering to Moses that he would be even with him, but little
thinking his chance would so soon come to hand. Passing out of the
Court into the street, he saw his own dog and that of Moses snarling
at one another, but harmlessly, as both were muzzled.  Taking a
knife from his pocket, he cut the leather straps that bound the
mouth of his own dog, and, throwing it at the other, bade it go to
work with its worrying. It needed no second word of encouragement;
and in a moment, the other dog, handicapped by its muzzle, was at
the mercy of its foe. Over and over they rolled, amid jeers, and
cheers, and curses, worrying, foaming, and choking, until at last
the dog owned by Moses was <i>hors de combat</i>, and helpless in
the other's grip.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fair play!&rsquo; cried some among the crowd. &lsquo;Cut
t'other dog's muzzle!&rsquo; screamed others. &lsquo;Tak' thy dog
off, Oliver,&rsquo; urged a youth, who saw the injustice of the
fight. Yet none dared to approach.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Moses appeared on the steps of the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page81" id="page81" title="81"></a>
Court-house, and seeing the peril of his much-loved dog, rushed into
the fray, defenceless as he was, and seizing his pet, tore it from
the grip of its opponent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;At him!&rsquo; cried Oliver, and in another moment Moses
and his dog were on the ground, and powerless beneath the attack of
the bull-terrier. Moses remembered no more. When he came to himself
he was lying in his bed, under the smart of the doctor's caustic and
his wife's fomentations.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is th' dog alive, missis?&rsquo; was the first question he
asked. And when told that it was, he faintly breathed a &lsquo;Thank
God!&rsquo; and fell away into another swoon.</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>&lsquo;Here's Mr. Penrose to see thee, Moses; mun I ax him
up?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa con do as thaa likes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come upstairs, Mr. Penrose; thaa con see him, he sez, if
thaa likes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right, Mrs. Fletcher; I'm coming,&rsquo; and in a
moment the minister was at the bedside of the sick man.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page82" id="page82" title="82"></a>
<p>Mr. Penrose and Moses were not the best of friends. Indeed, the
latter had threatened to gag the young preacher with the doctrinal
deeds of Rehoboth, and was only waiting his opportunity. Thus Mr.
Penrose hardly knew how to console this sick member of his flock,
and words refused to flow from his ministerial lips. After a
somewhat awkward pause, however, he ventured to remark:</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is the second time, I suppose, you have risked your
life on behalf of Captain, Mr. Fletcher.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, it is,&rsquo; responded Mrs. Fletcher. &lsquo;He geet
rheumatic fayver six year sin', when he poo'd it aat o' Green Fowd
Lodge; and now he's getten welly worried to deeath by savin' it fro'
that bull-terrier o' Oliver's o' Deaf Martha's.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ay! they'n welly done for us both this time, hevn't they,
Captain?&rsquo; faintly said Moses, addressing the dog, and
extending his hand wearily for a canine caress. &lsquo;But aar time
'll come.  Wee'n nobbud to wait, and we'll mak' it even wi' 'em
yet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you must not forget the Divine injunction,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page83" id="page83" title="83"></a>
Mr. Fletcher.  &ldquo;Avenge not yourselves; vengeance is Mine, I
will repay.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ay! bless yo',&rsquo; interrupted the wife, &lsquo;they
think as he's mad' 'em pay too mich already.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who, Mrs. Fletcher?&rsquo; asked the minister. &lsquo;The
Almighty?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay; I mean our Moses there. They say as he's awlus makin'
'em pay.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thee howd thi tung. I know mi business baat bein' helped
or hindered by thee, or onybody else.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This last with biting emphasis, as though to include the
pastor.</p>

<p>Then, turning to Mr. Penrose, he continued:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hoo'd let 'em off if hoo'd her way, but that's noan o' my
creed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think her creed is the better of the two, though, Mr.
Fletcher.  If thine enemy hunger, give him&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A summons if he willn'd pay for what he gets.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, the Bible does not say so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ne'er mind th' Bible&mdash;it's what aw say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After another painful pause, Mrs. Fletcher continued:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page84" id="page84" title="84"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Eh, Mr. Penrose, I do wish aar Moses 'ud find summat else
to do nor lendin' brass and collectin' debts. We haven't a friend i'
th' world naa, and we used never bein' baat. Mi own fo'k wernd look
at me naa, 'cose he caanty-courted aar Bella's husband.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thee howd thi tung, aw tell thee. Aw know mi wark; and if
fo'k willn'd pay for what they get, then they mun be made
to.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But supposing they cannot pay, Mr. Fletcher&mdash;what
then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What then? Then they mun go up yon,&rsquo; and Moses
extended his bandaged hand in the direction of the Union
workhouse.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you know there was One who said, &ldquo;Give to him
that asketh thee, and from him that borroweth turn not
away.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, but He didn'd live at Rehoboth. Th' pulpit's th' place
for that mak' o' talk. It'll do for Sundo; but fo'k as hes their
livin' to ged want noan on't i' th' week.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But is getting a living more essential than doing right?
If it came to a choice between the two, which would you
select?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw durnd know as that's ony business o'
<a class="pagebreak" name="page85" id="page85" title="85"></a>
yours. Th' owd Book yo' quote fro' says summat abaat a man stonnin'
and falling to his own Judge&mdash;doesn'd it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why keep all your kindness for your dog, Mr. Fletcher? Why
not extend the same acts of mercy to those who are of more value
than many dogs? If you did that your dog would not be your only
friend, nor would it be called upon to suffer for you as it
does.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I durnd know, Mr. Penrose, as I want ony
friends.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think there's one Friend you cannot do without&mdash;the
one you recommended me to keep in the pulpit. Don't you think we
need Him in the home as well?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ther's noabry kept Him aat o' aar haas, as I know on, hes
ther, Sally?&rsquo; said Moses, turning to his wife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Doesto think 'at onybody's axed Him?&rsquo; she replied.
&lsquo;And if He coome, what kind o' a welcome would He ged,
thinksto? I know thaa reckons to meet Him on a Sundo, and when thaa
sits at &ldquo;His table,&rdquo; as tha co's th' sacrament, and at
th' deacons' meetings. But that's abaat as mich on Him as yo' want,
I think.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page86" id="page86" title="86"></a>
<p>Mr. Penrose stood up to leave, but, recollecting himself, he
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Shall I pray with you, Mr. Fletcher?&rsquo;</p>

<p>To which he received the curt reply:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa con pleeas thisel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose knelt by the bedside of the poor
mammon-worshipper&mdash;self-blinded and hardened by the god of this
world&mdash;and with a full soul cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Merciful Father! Who hast forgiven so much, and in whose
continued forgiveness lies our only hope, inspire us with the spirit
of Thy forgiveness towards all men, and grant that Thy great heart,
which bears enmity towards none, may so warm these selfish hearts of
ours that we may not only love our neighbours but our enemies, with
the love wherewith we are loved. Pardon our littlenesses, consume
our selfishness, and fashion us after Him whose strength bore all
burdens, whose heart heard all entreaties, and whose love went out
alike to friend and foe. Amen.&rsquo;</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>It was in the golden autumn weather when Moses and his dog, for
the first time after the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page87" id="page87" title="87"></a>
<i>mêlée</i>, turned out for an afternoon's stroll. Both bore sore
evidences of the severity of the struggle, one being bandaged over
his forehead, the other following with tell-tale limp and disfigured
coat.</p>

<p>Not caring to face the inquisitorial eye of the villagers, nor
hear the rude sarcasm and stinging wit which he knew they would hurl
at him from their tongues, Moses turned down a foot-road leading
from his garden to Folly Clough, and thus secured the quiet ever
found in those deeply-wooded seams that plough into the very heart
of the moors. Following the water-worn path which wound in tortuous
ascent under clustering trees and between slopes of bracken, the two
soon gained the head of the Clough, and climbed towards the banks of
the Green Fold Lodge, a stretch of water into which drained the
moisture of vast tracts of uplands, its overflow rushing through
flood-gates and pouring its volume through the Clough to feed the
factories below. Seating himself on the bank of the Lodge, he
recalled the day when he rescued his dog from its chill deeps, and,
turning to Captain, he said:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page88" id="page88" title="88"></a>
<p>&lsquo;It wor welly bein' thi grave once, owd lad. Aw wonder why
it wor aw saved thee. Thaa's getten many a lickin' (thrashing) sin'
then on my accaant.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon the dog bounded round his feet, and held up its head
for one of those caresses which Moses was never known to extend save
to his dog.</p>

<p>As they rested together Moses continued:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaas noan a bad sort, Captain; and thaa'd ha' done a deal
more good if aw'd a let thee. Thaa wor awlus fond o' childer', bud
they'd never let thee alone. It wor happen as weel if aw'd a bit
more o' thi spirit i' me, owd lad; but if there wor more fo'k like
thee there'd be less like me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And at this Captain wagged his tail with delight, and rubbed his
cold nose under the palm of Moses' hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw've gin thee a bad name, owd mon, and they'n tried to
hang thee for't; but thaa'll happen do summat some day as they'll
tee a medal raand thi neck for, and when thaa'rt deead build thee a
moniment.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And Moses actually laughed at his burst of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page89" id="page89" title="89"></a>
mirth, which was of rare occurrence in his taciturn life.</p>

<p>Moses' wit, however, was soon cut short, for he started and
stayed his monologue at the sight of a child sailing paper boats on
the opposite and deeper side of the reservoir,</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, yon's that little lad o' Oliver o' Deaf
Martha's!&rsquo; exclaimed Moses to himself. &lsquo;What a foo'
(fool) his mother mun be to let him marlock on th' Lodge banks by
hissel. By Guy! he's i' th' watter!&rsquo;</p>

<p>At that moment Captain sprang up, and would have leapt after the
child, but Moses bade him lie still.</p>

<p>The dog, for the first time in its life, resented the command of
his master, and a low, ominous growl came from a mouth that
displayed a row of threatening teeth. At this Moses, for the first
time in his life too, raised his foot and kicked the brute he had so
lately been apostrophizing, and, seizing it by the collar, held it
to the spot.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa doesn't know whose bairn it is, Captain, or thaa'd
never trouble to go in after it. It's his whose dog welly worried
thee and me on th' Caanty Court day.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page90" id="page90" title="90"></a>
<p>But the instinct of Captain was nearer the thought of God than
was the moral nature of Moses, and, despite threat and cuff and
kick, the dog so dragged his collar that Moses, weak from his long
illness, felt he must either let go his hold or follow the leading
of the noble creature.</p>

<p>And now commenced a terrible struggle in the soul of Moses. He
turned pale, and great drops of sweat stood upon his brow, as he
felt himself in the grasp of a stronger and better nature than his
own. Looking round to see if his relentless act were watched, he
breathed more freely as he saw along the miles of moorland no sign
of human life. Only his eye, and the eye of Captain&mdash;and then
he realized that other Eye that filled all space&mdash;the Eye that
looked down from the cloudless light. Fiercely the struggle waged.
The voice of Moses cried out of the deeps of his own black heart,
&lsquo;My time has come, as I said it would.&rsquo; But the words of
Mr.  Penrose&mdash;heeded not when uttered&mdash;rang out clear and
telling: &lsquo;Vengeance is Mine, <i>I</i> will repay.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But is not <i>this</i> God's vengeance?&rsquo; replied the
voice of the lower man.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page91" id="page91" title="91"></a>
<p>And then came the reply:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Would God punish Oliver through his child as Oliver
punished you through your dog? Am I a man, and not God?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Moses looked round, as though someone had spoken in his ear, and,
loosing his hold of Captain, muttered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go, if thaa wants.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A mighty bound, and Captain was in mid-stream, and with a few
strong and rapid strokes he reached the sinking child. But the
flood-gates were open, the reservoir was emptying its overflow down
the steep falls into the Clough fifty yards below, and child and dog
were slowly but unmistakably being carried towards the gorge.</p>

<p>Again the struggle commenced, and once more Moses was the prey of
the relentless reasoners&mdash;Love and Self.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A man's life is worth more than a dog's,&rsquo; cried
Self.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And more than a child's?&rsquo; asked Love.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it's Oliver o' Deaf Martha's child, is it
not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And your dog is seeking to save it.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page92" id="page92" title="92"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Shamed by a dog!&rsquo; All the remains of the nobleness
so long dormant in the nature of Moses&mdash;the passion, and
valour, and love which he had allowed to die down long, long
ago&mdash;awakened into life. For the first time for thirty years he
forgot himself, and with a great light breaking round him, and
sounds of sweetest music in his heart, he leapt into the Lodge,
struck out for the struggling dog and its fainting burden, and
strengthened and steadied both to land.</p>

<p>Many years before Moses had been immersed in the baptistery at
Rehoboth by the old pastor, Mr. Morell. He stepped into those waters
as Moses Fletcher, and he was Moses Fletcher when he came up out of
them, despite the benediction breathed on his dedicated soul. But on
this autumn afternoon Moses Fletcher&mdash;the cruel, exacting,
self-righteous Moses Fletcher&mdash;was buried in baptism, and there
stepped out of those moorland waters another man, bearing in his
arms a little child.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page93" id="page93" title="93"></a>
<a name="chapter2.3" id="chapter2.3"></a>
<h3>III.</h3><h3>THE ATONEMENT OF MOSES FLETCHER.</h3>

<p>On the evening of the day following the rescue of Oliver o' Deaf
Martha's child, Moses Fletcher was walking over the moors towards
his own home, a great peace possessing his soul, and a buoyant step
bearing him through a new world. Above him the mellow moon of
September dreamed in blue distances, the immensities of which were
measured by innumerable constellations. Around, the great hills
loomed dark in shadow, and bulked in relief against the far-off
horizon of night. Along the troughs and gullies lay streaks of white
fog, ever shaping themselves into folds and fringes, and, like
wraiths, noiselessly vanishing on the hillside; while over all
rested a great stillness, as
<a class="pagebreak" name="page94" id="page94" title="94"></a>
though for once the fevered earth slept in innocence beneath the
benediction of that world so vast, so high, and yet so near. Many a
time, amid such surroundings, had Moses traversed the same path.
Never before, however, had he passed through the same world. To him
it was a new heaven and a new earth, for he carried with him a new
soul.</p>

<p>Crossing the stretch of hill on the crest of which lay the
Rehoboth burial-ground, Moses made his way to the stone wall fencing
in that God's acre, and paused to lean his arms on its rude and
irregular coping. There stood the old chapel, square and gaunt, its
dark outline clearly cut against the moonlit sky, each window coldly
gleaming in the pale light, while the scattered headstones, sheeted
in mist, stood out like groups of mourners mute in their sorrow over
the dead. Below lay the village&mdash;that little tragic centre of
life and death&mdash;half its inhabitants in sleep, hushed for a few
brief hours in their humble moorland nests. The fall of waters from
the weir at the Bridge Factory came up from the valley in dreamy
cadences; a light dimly burned in old Joseph's window; and a
<a class="pagebreak" name="page95" id="page95" title="95"></a>
meteor swept with a mighty arc the western sky. The soul of Moses
Fletcher was at peace.</p>

<p>He sprang with a light step over the low wall of boundary, and
crossed the wave-like mounds that heaved as a grassy sea, and
beneath which lay the unlettered dead, the long grasses writhing and
clinging to his feet, as though loath to let him escape the dust
upon which they fed and grew so rank. Heedless of their greedy
embrace, he walked with long stride towards the lower end of the
yard, until he stood before a gray and lichen-covered slab, on which
were letters old and new. There, by the moonlight, he read the
record of a baby boy of two, carrying back the reader forty years.
Above it was the name of a father, dead these ten years, and between
these, all newly cut, were the lines:</p>

<blockquote><center><big>JINNY CRAWSHAW,<br /><br />
WIFE OF THE ABOVE, WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE,</big>
<hr style="border-style:dashed none" width="20%"/></center></blockquote>

<p>For some moments Moses stood before the stone; then, taking the
hat from his head, he
<a class="pagebreak" name="page96" id="page96" title="96"></a>
knelt down on the cold grass and, kissing the newly-cut name, he
vowed a vow. If, with the power of his Master, whom he had only just
begun to serve, he could have raised the sleeper, as Lazarus and the
widow's son and the ruler's little child were raised, then the great
grief of his heart would have disappeared. But he could
not&mdash;the past, <i>his</i> past, was irrevocable. But there were
the living&mdash;Jim Crawshaw, his wife, his babe&mdash;these were
still within his reach of recompense. And again he vowed his vow,
and the still night air carried it far beyond the distant stars to
where He sits who knows the thoughts and tries the reins of men.</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>&lsquo;Thaa'rt lat' to-neet, Moses; where hasto bin?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowhere where thaa couldn't go wi' me, lass,&rsquo; and so
saying, Moses kissed his wife, an act which he had dexterously and
passionately performed several times since his immersion in the
Green Fold Lodge on the previous day.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whatever's come o'er thee, Moses? Thaa fair maks me
shamed. It's thirty year an' more sin' thaa kissed me. Hasto lost
thi yed?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page97" id="page97" title="97"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Yi, lass, but I've fun mi heart,&rsquo; and he again
clasped his startled wife, and grew young in his caresses.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I thought thaa kept thi luv for Captain, Moses. But I
durnd mind goin' hawves wi' th' owd dog. I awlus said that a chap as
could luv a dog hed summat good abaat him somewhere&mdash;and thaa's
luved Captain sum weel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And others a deal too little, lass. But all that's
o'er&rsquo;&mdash;and Moses burst into tears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, lad&mdash;forshure thaa'rt takken worse. Well, I
never seed thee cry afore. Mun I ged thee a sooap o' summat hot,
thinksto? or mun I run for th' doctor?&rsquo; and Mrs. Fletcher
looked at her husband with a scared and troubled face.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, lass, I've been cryin' all th' day&mdash;and that's
why I've bin so long away fro' thee&mdash;I didn'd want to scare
thee. I cornd help but cry. I tell thee I've fun mi
heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And Moses again sobbed like a child.</p>

<p>That night, when his wife was in bed, and Captain slept soundly
on the rug in front of the fire, Moses opened a safe that stood in
the corner of the room, and, taking therefrom a bundle of deeds,
selected one docketed &lsquo;Crawshaw
<a class="pagebreak" name="page98" id="page98" title="98"></a>
Fold.&rsquo; He then took from a drawer a number of agreements, and
carefully drew forth those which gave him his hold on the Crawshaws.
These he enclosed with the deeds in a large blue envelope, and in a
clerkly hand addressed them, with a note, to James Crawshaw. After
this he knelt down, and, as he prayed, Captain came and laid his
head upon the clasped hands of his master.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-mornin', Abram. Hasto ought fresh daan i' th'
village?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Plenty, Enoch; hasto yerd naught?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe; I hevn't bin daan fro' th' moors sin'
Sundo.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then yo've yerd naught abaat Moses Fletcher?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe; nor I durnd want. When yo' cornd yer owt good abaat
a mon yo'd better yer naught at all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I've summat good to tell thee abaat owd
Moses.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, lad, I think nod. Th' Etheop cornd change his skin,
nor th' leopard his spots.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page99" id="page99" title="99"></a>
<p>&lsquo;But Moses hes ged'n aat o' his skin, and changed it for a
gradely good un and o'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what abaat his spots, Abram?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, he's weshed 'em all aat in th' Green Fowd Lodge wi'
savin' Oliver o' Deaf Martha's little un.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Enoch whistled the first bar or two of an old tune, and stood
silent in thought, and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, aw'v yerd o' th' seven wonders, but if what thaa sez
is true, it mak's th' eighth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, owd mon, but there's a bigger wonder nor that. He's
gi'n Jim Crawshaw th' deeds o' Crawshaw Fowd, and towd him as he can
pay him back when he geds th' brass.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Abram, thaa'rt gammin'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Jim Crawshaw towd me this mornin', and I seed th' deeds
wi' mi own een in his hond, and read th' letter Moses bed
written.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this moment Mr. Penrose came along the field-path, and joined
the two men. He, too, was strangely excited about Moses Fletcher,
and, guessing what was uppermost in the minds and conversation of
the two men, at once heartily joined them.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page100" id="page100" title="100"></a>
<p>&lsquo;God moves in a mysterious way, doesn'd He, Mr.
Penrose?&rsquo; said old Enoch.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He does indeed, Enoch. Here I've been trying to convert
Moses with my preaching, and the Almighty sets aside His servant,
and converts the sinner by means of a dog and a little child. After
all, there's something can get at the heart besides theology and
philosophy. The foolishness of God is greater than the wisdom of
man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then yo' think he's convarted, Mr. Penrose?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, if the New Testament test is a true one, he is, for
he is indeed bringing forth fruits meet for repentance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is so,&rsquo; said Enoch, &lsquo;it what Abram sez is
true. I awlus towd my missus that whenever Moses gave his furst
hawve-craan it 'ud be his fust stride towards th' kingdom o' grace;
but if he's gin Jim Crawshaw his deeds back he's getten a deal
further into th' kingdom nor some o' us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose attempted to continue the conversation, but in vain,
for a lump rose in his throat, and the landscape was dimmed by the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page101" id="page101" title="101"></a>
moisture he could not keep back from his eyes. And as with the
pastor, so with his companions. A great joy filled all their
hearts&mdash;a joy too deep for words, but not for tears.</p>

<p>In a little while Mr. Penrose said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Moses called to see me last night to ask for re-admission
into the Church. He wants me to baptize him next Sunday afternoon
week, and would like to give his testimony.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But he were baptized thirty year sin' by Mr.
Morell,&rsquo; said Abram.  &lsquo;Why does he want dippin' o'er
agen?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because, as he says, he never received his testimony
before last Monday, when he saved Oliver's child from
drowning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' are yo' baan to baptize him?&rsquo; asked Enoch.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why not? If the deacons are willing, I shall be only too
glad.&rsquo;</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>It was the first Sunday afternoon in October, and along a dozen
winding moorland paths there came in scattered groups the
worshippers to the Rehoboth shrine. Old men and women, weary with
the weight of years, renewed their
<a class="pagebreak" name="page102" id="page102" title="102"></a>
youth as they drew near to what had been a veritable sanctuary amid
their care and sorrow and sin; while manhood and womanhood, leading
by the hand their little ones, felt in their hearts that zeal for
the house of prayer so common to the dwellers in rural England. Long
before the hour of service the chapel-yard was thronged, and from
within came the sounds of stringed instruments as they were tuned to
pitch by the musicians, who had already taken their place in the
singing-pew beneath the pulpit, which stood square and high,
canopied with its old-fashioned sounding-board and cornice of plain
deal. There was &lsquo;owd Joel Boothman,&rsquo; who had played the
double bass for half a century, resining his bow with a trembling
hand; and Joe and Robert Hargreaves fondly caressing their 'cellos.
Dick o' Tootershill and his two sons were delicately touching the
trembling strings of their violins; and Enoch was polishing, beneath
the glossy sleeve of his &lsquo;Sunday best,&rsquo; &lsquo;th' owd
flute&rsquo; which had been his salvation.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Mr. Penrose ascended the pulpit. Never before
was there such a congregation
<a class="pagebreak" name="page103" id="page103" title="103"></a>
to greet him; and as the people rose to join in singing the old
tune, Devizes, the worm-eaten galleries trembled and creaked beneath
the mass of worshippers. Then followed prayer and the lessons, the
hymn before the address being</p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;Come, ye that love the Lord.&rsquo;</blockquote>

<p>With a great swell of harmony from five hundred voices, whose
training for song had been the moors, the words of Dr. Watts went
up to heaven, and when the second verse was reached&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">
&lsquo;Let those refuse to sing,<br />
Who never knew our Lord,&rsquo;
</blockquote>
<p>little Milly, who had hobbled to chapel on her crutch, turned to
Abraham Lord, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sithee, owd Moses is singing, faither.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And it was even so. Poor Moses! for so many years a mute
worshipper, and whose voice had been raised only to harry and
distress, no longer was silent in the service of song.</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose's address was brief. Taking for his text, &lsquo;The
Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost,&rsquo; he
said:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page104" id="page104" title="104"></a>
<p>&lsquo;It was the best in man that was longest in being
discovered. That which was lost was not the false man, but the true
man&mdash;the heavenly. We were none of us vile in the sight of God,
because God saw Himself in us. It was this God-self in us that was
lost to us.  Not knowing it to be the hidden root of our true life,
we did not claim our dignity, nor walk as became the sons of God. A
man who lost the sense of his freedom, though free, would be
fettered still. A man whose sense of beauty was lost would be as in
a desert in the paradise of God. A lost sense of freedom meant a
slavish mind, and a lost sense of beauty meant a prosaic mind, no
matter how free the man, nor how beautiful his environment. So men
had lost the sense of their sonship. They did not know their royal
descent, their kinship with the Father, and therefore they did not
act as became sons. A lost sense of relationship begat in them
disobedience and alienation. They possessed gold, but were content
with brass; and instead of iron they built with clay. The eternal
and abiding was in them, but <i>lost</i> to them, covered with
incrustations of self and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page105" id="page105" title="105"></a>
buried deep beneath the lesser and the meaner man. There were times
in a man's life when the better nature gave hints of its existence.
The mission of Christ was to awaken these hints. He came to tell
them they were men, that they were souls, that they were sons and
not servants, friends and not enemies of God. When He stirred these
powers in men He stirred the lost. He set it before the eye of man,
and made man see what he had within him, what he was <i>really</i>,
and at the <i>root</i> of his being&mdash;a man, a Son of Man, a
Child of God. How hard this was only Christ knew. Spiritually, men
put themselves, through spiritual ignorance, in false relations.
This wrong relationship lay at the root of all disorder. It was the
secret of discomfiture, misery and sin. Men were not lost in
badness, not lost in sin, but lost to that which when discovered to
them made their badness unbearable&mdash;in other words, &ldquo;took
away their sin.&rdquo; Lost souls, damned souls, souls in
hell&mdash;as the theologians termed them&mdash;were simply souls
lost to their right relationship. And the work of Christ was to find
<i>in</i> men, and find out <i>for</i> men, what this right
relationship
<a class="pagebreak" name="page106" id="page106" title="106"></a>
was. This was what was meant in the text, the Son of Man came to
seek and to save that which was lost. Their friend Moses Fletcher
had found something in himself. He had found love, and courage, and
a sense of goodness. These had been discovered to him by the One who
was always revealing the good in us if we would but let Him, and if
we would but open our eyes to see. He, Moses Fletcher, had seen the
good, and believed in it, and he was saved because he allowed the
good to move and have its being in him. It was his better self, so
long unknown to himself, so long lost in him, and to him, that awoke
and led him to save Oliver o' Deaf Martha's child. When he plunged
into the Green Fold Lodge he found what had been so long lost to
him: he found himself. Then was fulfilled the saying, &ldquo;He that
loseth his life shall save it.&rdquo; That was salvation. Moses was
now a saved man because he had found the sane and whole part of his
nature. The Divine in him had been awakened. He was at last true to
the law of his being.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then, closing his Bible, he asked Moses Fletcher to give his
&lsquo;testimony.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page107" id="page107" title="107"></a>
<p>Standing up, and with tremulous tones, which none recognised as
the once harsh voice of Moses, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yo' happen willn't let me co yo' friends because I've bin
an enemy to so mony on yo'! But Him as they co'd a friend o'
publicans and sinners hes made me His friend, and He's made me a
friend on yo' all. I know haa yo' all hated me, and I gave yo' good
cause for doin' so. But He's put His love i' me, and naa owd Moses
'll never trouble ony on yo' ony more. Owd Moses lies i' Green Fold
Lodge yonder, and he'll stop theer; it's time he wor done wi'. An'
if you'll try me as God's baan to try me, aw think you'll happen
larn to love me as I know I'm loved aboon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As he sat down many in the large congregation would fain have
risen and grasped him by the hand, but propriety forbade.</p>

<p>In another minute Mr. Penrose came out of the vestry prepared for
the rite of immersion, and Moses was a second time baptized in
Rehoboth.</p>

<p>As he stepped out of the waters a cloud passed from before the
October sun, and a flood of light
<a class="pagebreak" name="page108" id="page108" title="108"></a>
poured through the open window above the baptistery, while a white
dove from the neighbouring farm perched for a moment on the wooden
sill. Then Milly once more turned to her father and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yon's th' brid, faither, but I don't yer th'
voice!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What voice?&rsquo; whispered Abraham Lord.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, faither, thaa knows&mdash;&ldquo;This is My beloved
Son.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Moses heard that voice in his heart.</p>

<h3>I.</h3><h3>HOME.</h3>

<p>She saw from afar the light of her cottage home, and her heart
misgave her. It was not wrath she feared; for had the relentless
anger of a parent awaited her, her step would have been braver, and
her spirit more defiant. But she knew she was forgiven. The feeble
ray emitted from the lamp in the far-off gable was the beacon of her
forgiveness&mdash;the proof that love's fire still burned brightly.
This it was that daunted her: she feared the scorch of its healing
flame.</p>

<p>She had travelled far, having crossed the moors from Burnt Gap,
climbing the ridge as the heavens began to kiss the earth with the
peace of sunset. A lingering glory was then haunting the summits and
crests and cairn-crowned
<a class="pagebreak" name="page112" id="page112" title="112"></a>
hills that shut in the quiet of Rehoboth and forming an almost
impassable rampart to those who, from the farther side, sought its
shelter ere the close of day. As she then lifted her eyes to these
many-coloured fires lighted by His hand who setteth His glory in the
heavens, they had seemed to burn in wrath; while the great moors,
dark in the foreground, raised themselves like
barriers&mdash;uplands of desolation, across which no path of hope
stretched its trend for returning feet.</p>

<p>As the girl climbed the Scar Foot the western sky was toning down
to grays, while beyond, and seen through an oval-shaped rift in
their sombre colours, lay a distant streak of amber that, moment by
moment, slowly disappeared under the closing lids of evening
cloud&mdash;the eye of weary day wooed to slumber by the hush of
illimitable sweeps of moor. Even so would Amanda fain have closed
her eyes and sunk to rest amid the purple clouds of heather that,
like a great sky, lay for miles around her feet.</p>

<p>Passing through Nockcliffe plantation, a half-mile of woodland
that straggled along the steep sides
<a class="pagebreak" name="page113" id="page113" title="113"></a>
of a clough, a drop of rain fell between the branches and coursed
down her cheek&mdash;a cheek fevered from want of tears, and flaming
with a sense of shame.  Then a low wind blew&mdash;a mere sob, but
so preludious, so prophetic!&mdash;followed by a silence that
discovered, as never before, the sense of her own loneliness, and in
which she heard the tread of her own light footfall over the moss
and herbage of the path she travelled.</p>

<p>Emerging from the plantation, an angry gust, laden with cold
drops, dashed itself in her face, and she knew from the weather-lore
which she, as a child of the hills, had learned in past years, that
a wild night was between her and the house whose shelter she sought
in her despair.</p>

<p>Phenomenally rapid was the onrush of the storm. At first the rain
fell in short and sudden showers, driven from angry clouds eager for
some atmospheric change whereby to be relieved of their pent-up
burden. Then the wind, as though in answer to the prayer of the
clouds, changed its course and stilled its moaning, and the sky
&lsquo;wept its watery vapours to the ground.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page114" id="page114" title="114"></a>
<p>When Amanda stood upon the fringe of the great moss that
stretched for three miles between the Scars and Rehoboth her spirit
sank within her. The season had been dry, and she knew the path by
instinct; but the storm and the darkness seemed like twin enemies
determined to bar her advance. She felt that Nature was her foe,
even as man had been, and as Rehoboth would be when it knew of her
return. Why did the rain hiss, and dash its cold and stinging
showers in her face? Why did it saturate her thin skirts so that
they, in chill folds, wrapped her wasted frame and clung cruelly to
her weary limbs to stay her onward travel? And why that strange,
weird sound&mdash;the sound muttered by miles of herbage when beaten
down by rain&mdash;the swish and patter and sigh of the long grass
and of the bracken, as they bent beneath the continuous fall, and
rose in angry protest, to fling off their burden on each other, or
shake it to the ground? Then a mute sympathy sprang up in her
desolate heart as she grew incorporate into this storm-swept,
helpless vegetation, and she felt that she, too, like it, was the
helpless prey of angry forces.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page115" id="page115" title="115"></a>

<p>The moss traversed, the twinkling lights of Rehoboth broke the
darkness. Yes, the old chapel was illuminated, the windows of that
rude structure glowing with warmth and life; and as she passed the
graveyard a hymn, only too well known to her in the happy days of
the past, reached her ears. Once this had been her sanctuary, a
shelter, a home, where as a happy girl she had sung that very
strain&mdash;then a house of prayer, now a temple of judgment. And
she grew rebellious as she saw in her mind the hard faces of its
worshippers, and realized that nothing unholy or unclean must enter
there. The native instinct, however, was too strong; and passing
through the gate, and stealthily crossing the sea of graves, she
paused to peep through the window, and, unobserved, took in the
scene. The old faces&mdash;Enoch, and Abraham, and Moses Fletcher,
and Malachi o' th' Mount, and Simon o' Long John's. Yes, the old
faces as she knew them five years ago&mdash;the old faces, all save
one. Where was the saintly Mr. Morell? In his place sat a young man
whom she knew not.</p>

<p>Hastening on, she climbed Pinner Brow, on
<a class="pagebreak" name="page116" id="page116" title="116"></a>
the summit of which lay her home. As she scaled the height the
beacon in her mother's gable told she was not forgotten. Then it was
she trembled. A rebuke&mdash;a curse&mdash;a refusal; these she
could face.  But
forgiveness&mdash;welcome&mdash;love&mdash;<i>never</i>! She turned
to fly.</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>&lsquo;Amanda!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mother!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The great, good God had ordained that the despairing girl should
fly into the arms of the one who had not forgotten, and who felt she
had nothing to forgive. Amanda found herself in the stillest and
strongest of all havens&mdash;the haven of a mother's breast.</p>

<p>In another moment Amanda permitted her mother to lead her as that
mother had been wont to lead her when the warm, strong hand of the
parent was a guiding touch&mdash;a magnet of love amid the dangers
of an early life&mdash;and when, as now, there was but one shelter
of safety&mdash;the home.</p>

<p>No sooner did the two women stand in the light and warmth of the
kitchen-hearth, than the elder fell on the neck of the younger, and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page117" id="page117" title="117"></a>
kissed the cold, rain-washed face of her child, with a love grown
fierce by years of hopeless hope and unrequited longing.  Once again
those arms, thin and weak with age, grew strong; and in the
resurrection of a mighty passion, all the old womanhood and
motherhood of the parent renewed their youth, and filled out the
shrunken and decrepit form until she stood majestic in the strength
of heaven. To those who had been wont to see Amanda's mother bent
and crushed with years and sorrow, the woman that now stood in the
firelight would not have been recognised as Mrs.  Stott. Once the
fairest and most lithesome girl in Rehoboth, the pride of the
village, the sought of many suitors, the proud wife of Sam Stott of
th' Clowes, and the still prouder mother of Amanda, who matched her
alike in beauty and in sprightliness, she had long been a prey to
the sling and arrows of outrageous fortune. Years had played sad
havoc with her, her money taking wings, her husband dying, and her
last hope failing in the hour of need. Now she was herself again
under the renewing hand of love.</p>

<p>As soon as Amanda recovered from the shock
<a class="pagebreak" name="page118" id="page118" title="118"></a>
of her mother's appearance, and felt the warmth of her welcome, she
gently, yet determinately, released herself and cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Durnd, mother, durnd! I'm noan come wom' to be kissed nor
forgiven. I've nobbud come wom' to dee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What saysto, lass?&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Stott.
&lsquo;Come wom' to dee? Nay, thaa's bin deead long enugh a'ready;
it's time thaa begun to live, and thank God thaa's come back to live
at wom'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl shook her head, a stony stare in her eye, her mouth
drawn into a hard and immobile line. And then, in cold tones, she
continued:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, mother; I've hed enugh o' life. I tell thee I've come
wom' to dee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Amanda,&rsquo; sobbed the mother, &lsquo;if thaa taks on
like that thaa'll kill me. Thaa's welly done for me a'ready, but I
con live naa thaa's come back, if thaa'll nobbud live an' o', and
live wi' me.  Sit thee daan. There's th' owd cheer (chair) waiting
for thee.  It's thi cheer, Amanda; awlus wor, and awlus will be. Sit
thee daan. It looks some onely (lonely) baat thee.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page119" id="page119" title="119"></a>
<p>There stood Amanda's chair, the chair of her girlhood, the chair
in which she had sung through the long winter nights, in which her
deft fingers had wrought needlework, the envy of Rehoboth. The old
arms mutely opened as though to welcome her; the rockers, too,
seemed ready to yield that oscillation so seductive to the jaded
frame. And the trimmings! and the cushion! the same old pattern,
somewhat faded, perhaps, but as warm and cosy as in the days of
yore. It was the chair, too, at which she used to kneel, the chair
that had so often caught the warm breath from her lips as she had
whispered, &lsquo;Our Father, which art in heaven.&rsquo; But had
she not forfeited her right to that chair? Of that throne of
sanctity she felt she was now no longer queen. And again, as her
mother pressed her to take her appointed place, she shook her head,
her heart steeled with pride and shame, the hardest of all bonds to
break when imprisoning a human soul.</p>

<p>The poor mother stood at bay&mdash;at cruel bay. She had used the
mightiest weapon upon which she could lay her hand, and it had
seemed to shiver in the conflict. But love's armoury is
<a class="pagebreak" name="page120" id="page120" title="120"></a>
not easily depleted, and love's spirit is quick to return to the
charge.  There was still left to her the warmth of a bosom in which
long years before Amanda had gently stirred, and from which she had
drawn her first currents of life; and once more the mother clasped
her girl, and pressed her lips on the sin-stained face.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Durnd kiss me, mother,&rsquo; cried the affrighted girl,
stepping back; &lsquo;durnd kiss me. Thaa munnot dirty thy lips wi'
touchin' mine. If thaa knew all, thaa'd spurn me more
like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;'Manda,&rsquo; replied the woman, in the desperation of
her love, &lsquo;I'll kiss thee if thaa kills me for't. I connot
help it; thaa'rt mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wor once, I wor once, but nod now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi! lass, but thaa art. Thaa wor mine afore th' devil geet
howd on thee, and thaa's bin mine all th' time he's bed thee, and
now he's done wi' thee, I mean to keep thee all to mysel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And afresh the mother bathed the still beautiful face of Amanda
with her tears.</p>

<p>But Amanda was firm. Old as her mother was, she knew that
mother's innocence, and shrank from the thought that one so pure, so
womanly, should hang on those lips so sorely
<a class="pagebreak" name="page121" id="page121" title="121"></a>
blistered by the breath of sin; and, once more stretching out her
arm, she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Durnd touch me, mother&mdash;durnd!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;'Manda,&rsquo; cried the mother, defiantly and grandly,
all the passion of maternity rising in her heart, &lsquo;'Manda,
thaa cornd unmother me.  I carried thee and suckled thee and taught
thee thi prayers in that cheer, and doesn'd ta think as Him we co'd
&ldquo;Aar Faither&rdquo; is aar Faither still?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Happen He's yours, mother; but He's noan o'
mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, 'Manda, if thaa'rt noan His child, thaa'rt mine, and
naught shall come 'tween me and thee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And dun yo' mean to say that yo' love me as mich naa,
mother, as when aw wor a little un?&rsquo; asked the girl, her
steely eyes moistening, and the firm line of her drawn mouth
tremulous with rising emotion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lass, and a thaasand times more. Thaa wants more luv'
naa nor then&mdash;doesn't ta? And hoo's a poor mother as connot
give more when more's wanted. I'm like th' owd well up th' hill
yonder&mdash;th' bigger th' druft (drought) th'
<a class="pagebreak" name="page122" id="page122" title="122"></a>
stronger th' flow. Thi mother's heart's noan dry, lass, tho' thi
thirst's gone; and I'll luv' thee though thaa splashes mi luv' back
in mi face, and spills it on th' graand.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And a third time the woman fell on the girl's neck, and kissed
her flesh into flame with the passion of her caress.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Durnd, mother! durnd!&rsquo; said Amanda. &lsquo;Blame me,
if yo' like; curse me, if yo' like. But luv' I connot ston'; it
drives me mad.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, lass; luv' noan drives folk mad. It's sin as does
that. As Mr. Penrose towd 'em at Rehoboth t'other Sunday, it were
luv' as saved th' world, and not wrath; and they say they are baan
to bring him up at th' deacons' meeting abaat it. But he's reet.
It's luv' as saves. It's saved thee to me; it's kept mi heart warm,
and it's kept that lamp leeted every neet for five year.&rsquo; And
then, seeing tears slowly stealing down her daughter's face, the old
woman said: &lsquo;I think we mud as weel put th' leet aat naa
thaa's comed wom', 'Manda?&rsquo; and as the girl gave no more
evidence of resistance, the mother went to the window, turned down
the lamp, and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page123" id="page123" title="123"></a>
drew the blind, saying, &lsquo;He's answered mi prayers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At the going out of that light there went out in Amanda's heart
the false fires of lust and pride and defiance, and in their place
was kindled the light of repentance&mdash;of forgiveness and of
love.  For five years that faithfully-trimmed lamp told the whole
countryside that Widow Stott was not forgetful of her own; and when
once or twice rebuked by some of the Rehoboth deacons at the premium
which she seemed to put on sin by thus inviting a wanderer's return,
she always replied:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Blame Him as mak's a woman so as hoo cornd forget her
child.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now that the lamp was out a flutter of excitement was passing
through the village, Milly Lord being the first to discover it.
She, poor girl! was sitting at her little window listening to the
beat of the rain, and the swish of the grasses that grew in her
garden below&mdash;sitting and wondering how it was there were no
&lsquo;angel een&rsquo; looking down at the earth, and keeping her
eye fixed on the gable light of Mrs. Stott's lone homestead.
Suddenly this light disappeared. If
<a class="pagebreak" name="page124" id="page124" title="124"></a>
the sun had gone out at noonday Milly would not have been more
startled. Night after night she had watched that light, and night
after night she had heard her mother tell the oft-repeated story of
Amanda's fall. Once, indeed, Milly startled her mother in its
repetition by saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Happen, if I hadn't lost mi leg, mother, I should ha'
sinned as Amanda did.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And then Milly's mother drew the girl close to her heart, and
thanked God for a lamb safe in the fold. No wonder when Milly saw
the light go out that she cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mother! mother! Amanda Stott's come wom'!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whatever will hoo say next?&rsquo; gasped Mrs. Lord.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I tell yo' Amanda's come wom'. Th' leet's aat&mdash;thaa
con see for thisel!&rsquo; and the girl was beside herself with
excitement.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lord. &lsquo;Bud it's noan
Amanda; it's happen her mother as is takken bad. Awl put o' mi
things, and run up and see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hurrying up the Pinner Brow, it was not long before Mrs. Lord
reached the home of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page125" id="page125" title="125"></a>
Amanda, and raising the latch, with the permission which rural
friendship grants, she saw the daughter and mother together on the
so long lonely hearth. Taken aback, and scarcely knowing how to
remove the restraint which the sudden interruption was imposing, she
fell upon the instinct of her heart, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I never! if our Milly isn't reet! Hoo said as how
hoo know'd Amanda bed come back. Hoo seed th' leet go aat and co'd
aat at th' top o' her voice, &ldquo;Amanda's come back.&rdquo; Hoo
remembers thee, Amanda, an' hoo's never stop't talkin' abaat thee.
Tha'rt eight year owder nor hoo is&mdash;poor lass! hoo's lost her
leg sin' thaa seed her. It wor a bad do, aw con tell thee; but hoo's
as lively as a cricket, bless her! and often talks abaat thee, and
wonders where thaa'd getten to. Let's see, lass, it's five years sin
thaa left us, isn't it?&rsquo; And then, remembering the whole story
of Amanda, which in her excitement she had forgotten, and the great
trouble and the great joy which that night fought for supremacy in
the little moorland home, she stopped, and with a tear-streamed face
rushed up to Amanda, and said: &lsquo;What am I talkin' abaat, lass?
I'd
<a class="pagebreak" name="page126" id="page126" title="126"></a>
clean forgetten,&rsquo; and then she, too, imprinted on Amanda's
lips a caress of welcome.</p>

<p>It was late that night when Milly asked her father to go up
Pinner Brow and fetch her mother home. When he reached the house he
found the two women and the girl upon their knees, for Milly's
mother was a good woman, and to her goodness was added a mother's
heart.  Her own sorrow had taught her to weep with those who weep,
and a great trial through which she had passed in her girlhood days,
and through which she had passed scathless, led her to look on
Amanda with pitying love. Abraham paused upon the threshold as he
heard the sound of his wife's voice in prayer, and when, half an
hour afterwards, they together descended the brow towards their
home, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa sees, lass, Milly's angel een wor on th' watch a'ter
all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi,&rsquo; said his wife, &lsquo;and they see'd a
returnin' sinner. But hoo's safe naa; hoo's getten back to her
mother, and hoo's getten back to God.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where hes hoo bin, missus, thinksto?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, lad, I never ax'd her. I know where hoo's getten to,
and that's enugh. I'm noan
<a class="pagebreak" name="page127" id="page127" title="127"></a>
one for sperrin (asking questions) baat th' past.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But they'll be wantin' to know up at th' chapel where
hoo's bin.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They'll happen do more good by doin' by Amanda as th'
Almeety does.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Doesto mean i' His judgments?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe! theer's summat more wonderful nor them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What doesto mean?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I mean His <small>FORGEETFULNESS</small>.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page128" id="page128" title="128"></a>
<a name="chapter3.2" id="chapter3.2"></a>
<h3>II.</h3><h3>LIGHT AT EVENTIDE.</h3>

<p>While Amanda's return aroused the curiosity of Rehoboth, it drew
few callers to the cottage on Pinner's Brow. Not that the villagers
were all wanting in kindliness, but Amanda's mother, being a woman
of strong reserve, had fenced herself off from much friendly
approach; while the nature of the trouble through which she was now
passing was felt by the rude moorlanders to impose silence, and
deter them from all open signs of sympathy.</p>

<p>Apart from Mrs. Lord and a girl friend or two of Amanda's, the
joy of return was pent up in the heart of the mother&mdash;a joy
which she, poor thing, would fain have sought to share with others
had not delicacy of instinct and sense of shame forbade. She felt it
to be indeed
<a class="pagebreak" name="page129" id="page129" title="129"></a>
hard that she could not go among her neighbours and friends and say,
&lsquo;Rejoice with me, for I have found my child which was
lost.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the mother's joy was also mixed with the alloy of Amanda's
despair. On the day after the return, the girl had taken to her bed;
and despite a mother's love and Mrs. Lord's kind counsel and cheery
words, Amanda went down into the valley of the shadow.  Seldom
speaking, save to reiterate the statement that she had come home to
die, and that all was dark, she lay anticipating the hour when, as
she said, &lsquo;the great God would punish her according to her
sins.&rsquo; This idea had taken fast hold of her mind: she was
going to hell to burn for ever and for ever, and she would only get
her deserts; she had sinned&mdash;she must suffer.</p>

<p>With the strain of constant watching, and the long hours of
solitude, and the nightmare of her girl's damnation hanging over her
yearning heart, the poor mother's condition verged on madness, until
at last she summoned courage to ask Mr. Penrose to call and drop
some crumbs of his Gospel of comfort and love at the bedside of her
child; for, as she said to Mrs. Lord,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page130" id="page130" title="130"></a>
&lsquo;even the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the master's
table.&rsquo; The truth was that hitherto Mr. Penrose had not cared
to risk the scandal which he knew would be created in the village by
a visit on his part to Amanda Stott. When, however, he received his
summons from the mother, and a sharp reprimand from Dr. Hale, who
told him that a minister was as free to visit without risk to his
character as a doctor, he resolved to throw aside proprieties and
obey the call.</p>

<p>As Mr. Penrose was walking up Pinner Brow, towards the house of
Mrs. Stott, he unexpectedly met Amos Entwistle, the senior
superintendent of the Sunday-school, and known to the children as
&lsquo;Owd Catechism,&rsquo; because of his persistent enforcement
of the Church tenets on their young minds.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good a'ternoon, Mr. Penrose. And what may bring yo' in
this direction?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'm looking after some of my sheep, Amos.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not th' black uns, I hope.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No! I am looking after the hundredth&mdash;the one that
went astray.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Better leave her alone, Mr. Penrose. There's
<a class="pagebreak" name="page131" id="page131" title="131"></a>
an owd sayin' i' these parts that yo' cornd go into th' mill baat
gettin' dusted.  That means in yur talk that yo' cornd touch pitch
baat gettin' blacked. If thaa goes to Mrs. Stott's they'll say
thaart goan for naught good. If thaa wur a married mon, naa, and bed
childer, it 'ud happen be different; but bein' single, thaa sees,
th' aatside o' yon threshold is th' reight side for such as thee and
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(Amos, be it known, was an old bachelor of over seventy years of
age.)</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Amos; you are reversing the teaching of the
Master. He went after the sinner, did He not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, He did; and He lost His repetation o'er it. They co'd
Him a winebibber, and a friend o' all maks o' bad uns. I couldn't
like 'em to say th' same abaat thee. Rehoboth 'ud noan ston' it,
thaa knows.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose did not know whether to laugh or to be serious.
Seeing, however, that Amos was in no laughing mood, he turned
somewhat sharply on the old man, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Stotts are in trouble, and they ask for my presence,
Good-afternoon; I'm going.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page132" id="page132" title="132"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Howd on a bit,&rsquo; said Amos, still holding the
minister by the lapel of his coat. &lsquo;Naa listen to me. If I
were yo' I wouldn't go.  Th' lass hes made her bed; let her lie
on't. Durnd yo' risk yor repetation by makkin' it yasier, or by
takkin' ony o' th' thorns aat o' her pillow. Rehoboth Church is
praad o' her sheep; and it keeps th' black uns aatside th' fold, and
yo'll nobbud ged blacked yorsel if yo' meddle wi' 'em. But young
colts 'll goa their own gait, so pleeas yorsel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At first Mr. Penrose was inclined to think twice over the old
Pharisee's advice; but, looking round, he saw Mrs. Stott's sad face
in her cottage doorway, and her look determined his advance.  In a
moment reputation and propriety were forgotten in what he felt were
the claims of a mother's heart and the sufferings of an erring
soul.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ay, Mr. Penrose, I'm some fain to see yo',&rsquo; cried
the poor woman, as the minister walked up the garden-path.
&lsquo;Amanda's baan fast, and hoo sez 'at it's all dark.&rsquo; And
then, seizing Mr. Penrose's hand, she cried: &lsquo;Yo' durnd think
hoo's damned, dun yo'?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page133" id="page133" title="133"></a>
<p>For years the sound of that mother's voice as she uttered those
words haunted Mr. Penrose. He heard it in the stillness of the
night, and in the quiet of his study; it came floating on the winds
as he walked the fields and moors; and would sound in mockery as he,
from time to time, declared a Father's love from the old pulpit at
Rehoboth. What cruel creed was this, prompting a mother to believe
that God would damn the child whom she herself was forced, out of
the fulness of her undying love, to take back into her house and
into her heart?</p>

<p>As the minister and Mrs. Stott sat down in the kitchen, the poor
woman, in the depths of her despair, again raised her eager face and
asked:</p>

<p>&lsquo;But yo' durnd think Amanda's damned, dun yo'?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I do not, Mrs. Stott.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was too much for the mother; and now that the highest
passions in her soul received the affirmative of one whom she looked
up to as the prophet of God, she felt her girl was safe.  The fire
of despair died out of her eyes, quenched in the tears of joy, and
she realized, as never
<a class="pagebreak" name="page134" id="page134" title="134"></a>
before, that she could now love God because God had spared to her,
and to Himself, her only child.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But, Mr. Penrose, Amanda says <i>it's all dark</i>. Dun
yo' think yo' could lift th' claads a bit?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, we'll do our best; but to the One who loves her the
darkness and the light are both alike.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And with these words on his lips, he followed the mother to where
the sick girl lay.</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose had often heard of Amanda Stott, and of that face of
hers which had been both her glory and her shame. Now, as he looked
upon it for the first time, he saw, as in a glass, the reflection of
a character and a life. There was the gold and the clay. The brow
and eyes were finely shaped and lustrous, giving to the upper half
of the face grandeur and repose, but the mouth and chin fell off
into a coarser mould, and told of a spirit other than that so nobly
framed under the rich masses of her dark hair.  It was a face with a
fascination&mdash;not the fascination of evil, but of
struggle&mdash;a face betraying battle between forces pretty
<a class="pagebreak" name="page135" id="page135" title="135"></a>
evenly balanced in the soul. But there was victory on it. Mr.
Penrose saw it, read it, understood it. There were still traces of
the scorching fire; these, however, were yielding to the verdure of
a new life; the garden, which had been turned into a wilderness, was
again blossoming as the rose.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Amanda, here's Mr. Penrose to see thee. I've bin tellin'
him it's all dark to thee. It is, isn't it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Amanda turned her head towards the wall, and answered
not.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Amanda!&rsquo; said the mother, in tones that only once or
twice, and that in the great crises of maternity, fall from woman's
lips&mdash;&lsquo;Amanda, speyk. Tell him what's botherin'
thee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the girl was silent.</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose was silent also, and nothing was heard in the room
save the tremulous beat of an old watch that hung over the
chimney-shelf&mdash;one of the memorials of a husband and father
long since taken, and now almost forgotten.</p>

<p>At last Amanda, without turning her face towards the pastor,
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sir, I'm a sinner&mdash;a lost sinner.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page136" id="page136" title="136"></a>
<p>&lsquo;No, you are not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Penrose.</p>

<p>And overawed and astonished with the boldness of his statement,
he relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>Amanda turned and looked at him clearly and unflinchingly, and
cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;How dare yo' say that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because you've repented,&rsquo; was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Haa do yo' know I've repented?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because repentance is to come home; and you've come home,
have you not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Repentance is to come wom'?&rsquo; slowly repeated the
girl, as though some ray of light was penetrating the darkness.
&lsquo;Repentance is to come wom', sen yo'?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And then Mr. Penrose repeated the words: &lsquo;And he arose and
came to his home; and when he was a great way off his father saw him
and ran, and fell on his neck and kissed him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw dare say; that's what mi mother did to me on th' neet I
come wom'. But mi mother's noan God, is hoo?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page137" id="page137" title="137"></a>
<p>&lsquo;No; but if you had had no God, you could not have had a
mother.  You tell me your mother kissed you. Did you not feel God's
kiss in that which your mother gave you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl shook her head; the pastor needed to make his message
more plain.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's in this way, you know,&rsquo; continued Mr. Penrose.
&lsquo;If there were no rain in the heavens there would be no
springs in the valleys, would there? The well is filled because the
clouds send down their showers; and so it is with love. Your
mother's heart is full of love because God, who Himself is love,
fills it. Your mother stands to you for God, and she is most like
God when she is doing most for you; and when she kissed you and took
you back again home, she was only doing what God made her do, and
what God did Himself to you through her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But theer's summat else beside forgiveness, Mr. Penrose. I
feel I've lost summat as I con never ged agen. I know I've getten
back wom', but I haven't getten back what awv' lost.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You may have it back, though, if it's worth
<a class="pagebreak" name="page138" id="page138" title="138"></a>
having back. There was One who came to seek that which was lost. You
are like the woman who lost one of her pieces of silver; but she
found it again, and what you have lost Jesus will find and restore
to you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But theer's th' past, Mr. Penrose, as well as th' lost.
It's all theer afore me. Aw see it as plain as aw see yon moors
through th' window, only it's noan green and breet wi'
sunshine&mdash;it's dark.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If God forgets the past, Amanda, why should you recall it?
Look out through that window again. There's a cloud just dying away
on the horizon yonder. Do you see it? It is changing its colour and
losing its shape, and in a moment it will be gone. Watch it! It is
almost gone. See! now it <i>is</i> gone&mdash;gone where? Gone into
the light of that sun which is making the moors so green and bright.
Now that is what God is doing with your past&mdash;with what you
call your sins&mdash;blotting them out like a cloud. It is God's
mercy that stands like the everlasting hills, and it is our
sinfulness and our past that pass away like clouds. As you look at
those hills you must think of His mercy, and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page139" id="page139" title="139"></a>
as you watch those vanishing clouds you must think of your
past.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Once more there was silence in the sick-chamber, and the little
watch ran its race with the beating, flickering pulse of Amanda.
The girl turned her face towards the window that overlooked the
moors, and begged her mother to open it so that she might again feel
the cool airs that swept across their heathery wastes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stott at once unhasped the casement, and a tide of life came
stealing in, noiselessly lifting the curtains, and cooling the
hectic flame that glowed on Amanda's wasted cheeks, and bearing,
too, on its waves fragrances that recalled a long-lost paradise, and
sounds&mdash;the echo of days when no discordant note marred the
music of her life. These moorland breezes&mdash;how redolent, how
murmurous of what had been! In a few moments Amanda closed her eyes,
the wind caressing her into peacefulness and singing her to
slumber.</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>It was the hour before dawn&mdash;the dark hour when minutes walk
with leaden feet and the departing vapours of night lay chilliest
finger on
<a class="pagebreak" name="page140" id="page140" title="140"></a>
the sick and dying, and on those who watch at their side. From the
mantelshelf the lamp emitted its feeble rays, dimly lighting the
lonely chamber, and holding, as with uncertain hand, the shadows
which crowded and cowered in the distant corners and recesses of the
room, and throwing into Rembrandtesque the pallid face of the
wakeful mother, and the flushed and fevered face of the slumbering
child. The little watch beat bravely to the march of time, eager to
keep pace with that never-flagging runner; while the quick and
feeble breathing of the girl told how she was fast losing in the
race with the all-omnipotent hours. On a small table stood two
phials, in which were imprisoned dull-coloured liquids, powerless,
despite their supposed potency, to stay the hunger of the disease so
rapidly consuming the patient; and by their side was a plate of
shrivelled fruit, the departing lusciousness of which had failed to
tempt an appetite in her whose mouth was baked with the fever that
fed on its own flame. There, gathered into a few cubic feet of
space, met the great triune mystery of night, of suffering, of
sin&mdash;the unfathomable problems of the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page141" id="page141" title="141"></a>
universe; there God, the soul, and destiny, together and in silence,
played out their terribly real parts.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Stott looked at her daughter tossing in restless sleep,
the natal hour came back to her, and in memory she again travailed
in birth. She recalled the joy of the advent of that life now so
fast departing, and tried to say, &lsquo;The Lord gave, and the Lord
hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.&rsquo; The words
died on her lips. Had it been a blessed thing on the part of God to
give to her a child who brought disgrace on her family name? And now
that her child was restored, with a possibility of redeeming the
past, was it a blessed thing of God to take her? As these hideous
thoughts chased one another through her over-wrought mind, they
seemed to embody themselves in the terrible shadows that leapt and
fought like demons on the wall, mere mockeries of her helplessness
and despair.</p>

<p>Her eye, however, fell on the Bible, and taking it up and opening
it at random, she read, &lsquo;Remember, O Lord, the children of
Edom in the day of Jerusalem. O daughter of Babylon,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page142" id="page142" title="142"></a>
who art to be destroyed, happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth
thy little ones against the stones.&rsquo; Hurriedly turning over
the leaves, her eyes again fell upon words that went like goads into
her heart: &lsquo;Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let
it look for light but have none; neither let it see the dawning of
the day, because it shut not up the doors of my mother's
womb.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried she, the old Calvinist life reasserting
itself in her soul&mdash;&lsquo;what! have the curses o' God getten
howd o' me?&rsquo;</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>&lsquo;Mother!&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was the voice of Amanda, and its sound called back the ebbing
tides of maternity as the clear notes of a bugle rally the
dispirited and flying forces on an undecided field.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mother, will yo' draw that blind?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What doesto want th' blind drawin' for, Amanda?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want to see th' morn break.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whatever for, lass?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Stott, as she drew
the cord with tremulous hand.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the girl looked out at the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page143" id="page143" title="143"></a>
distant horizon with a breaking light in her own eyes. Then, taking
her mother's hand, she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dun yo' see that rim o' gowd (gold) on the hills
yonder?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lass; forsure I do. What abaat it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Watch it, mother! See yo', it geds broder&mdash;more like
a ribbin&mdash;a brode, yollow ribbin, like that aw wore i' mi hat
when I were a little lass. Yo' remember, durnd yo'?&mdash;I wore it
one charity sarmons.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw remember, Amanda,&rsquo; said the parent, choking with
the reminiscences of the past which the old hat and its yellow
ribbon aroused.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Naa see, mother,&rsquo; continued the girl, her eye fixed
on the opening sky; &lsquo;it's like a great sea&mdash;a sea o'
buttercups, same as used to grow in owd Whittam's field when yo'
couldn't see grass for flaars.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lass, I see,&rsquo; sobbed Mrs. Stott.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And thoose claads, mother! See yo' haa they're goin'. And
th' hills and moors? Why I con see them plainer and plainer! Haa
grond they are! They're awlus theer. Them, Mr. Penrose said, stood
for God's love, didn't he,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page144" id="page144" title="144"></a>
mother?&mdash;and them claads as are lifting for my sins.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lass; he did, forsure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The dawn advanced, and before its majestic march there fled the
shadows of night that for such long hours had made earth desolate.
In the light of this dawn were seen those infinite lines of strength
which rose from broad and massive bases, and, sweeping upwards, told
of illimitable tracts beyond&mdash;mighty waves on the surface of
the world's great inland seas, on whose crests sat the green and
purple foam of herbage, and in whose hollows lay the still life of
home and pasture. Silent, changeless, secure, perpetual sublimity
rested on their summits, and unbroken repose lay along their
graceful sweeps. They were the joy-bearers to the poor child of
sorrow, who with eager eye looked out on their morning revelations.
To her the mountains had brought peace.</p>

<p>That day was a new day to Amanda&mdash;a birthday&mdash;a day in
which she realized the all-embracing strength and sufficiency of a
Divine love. As the hours advanced the clouds gathered and showers
fell, only, however, to be swept
<a class="pagebreak" name="page145" id="page145" title="145"></a>
away by the wind, or dissolved into the light of the sun. These
ever-changing, ever-dissolving, many-coloured vapours were watched
by Amanda, who now saw in them the fleeting and perishable sins of
her past life, and again and again, as one followed the other into
oblivion, she would breathe a sigh of relief, and then allow her
eyes to rest on the great hills that changed not, and which seemed
to build her in with their strength.</p>

<p>From that day forward a great trust came upon her. She ceased to
fret, and never again recalled what had been. Just as the chill of
winter is forgotten in the glory of the springtide, and just as the
child in the posied meadow sports in unconsciousness of the nipping
frost that a few weeks before forced the tears to his eyes, so
Amanda, playful, gladsome, and full of wonder in the new world in
which she found herself, knew no more her old self, nor remembered
any more her old life. The day had broken and the shadows flown, and
God's child was like a young hart on the mountains of Bether.</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<a class="pagebreak" name="page146" id="page146" title="146"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Mother, dun yo' think they'd put my name on th' Church
register agen at Rehoboth?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I cornd say, mi Jass, I'm sure. But why doesto ax
me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Becose I should like to dee a member of th' owd place. Yo'
know I were a member once. Sin' I've been lyin' here I've had some
strange thoughts. Dun yo' know, I never belonged to God then as I do
naa, for all I were baptized and a communicant. It's queer, isn't
it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ey, lass; thaa'd better tell that to Mr. Penrose. I know
naught abaat what yo're talkin' on. Bud it does seem, as thaa ses,
quare that thaa belongs more to God naa nor thaa did when thaa went
away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, mother, it's noan exactly as yo' put it. I durnd mean
as God's changed; it's me as has changed, durnd yo' see? I never
knew or loved Him afore, and I know and love Him naa.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That afternoon, when Mr. Penrose called, Amanda's mother told him
all her daughter had said, and made known to him as the pastor of
the Church the request for readmission and the administration of the
sacrament.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page147" id="page147" title="147"></a>
<p>Mr. Penrose, however, shook his head. As far as he was concerned,
no one would have been more willing. But the deacons ruled his
Church, and many of them were hard and exacting men&mdash;men with
the eye and heart of Simon of old, who, while they would welcome
Christ to meat, would put the ban upon &lsquo;the woman who was a
sinner.&rsquo; Nor dared Mr. Penrose administer the sacrament to one
whose membership was not assured, for he ministered to those of a
close sect, and a close sect of the straitest order. As the mother
pleaded for her child, he saw rising before him a difficulty of
which he had often dreamed, but never before faced&mdash;a
difficulty of ministering to a Church fenced in by deeds, the letter
of which he could not in his inner conscience accept.</p>

<p>The mother was importunate, however, and eventually the pastor
promised to bring the matter before his deacons.</p>

<p>What the decision of these deacons was will be told in another
Idyll of Rehoboth.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page148" id="page148" title="148"></a>

<h3>III.</h3><h3>THE COURT OF SOULS.</h3>

<p>&lsquo;I'm noan for bringin' th' lass back into th' Church. Hoo's
noan o'er modest, or hoo would never ax us to tak' her
back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Same here, Amos! What does hoo want amang dacent Christian
fo'k?&rsquo; And so saying, Elias Bradshaw opened a large
pocket-knife and closed it again with a sharp click, and then toyed
with it in his hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It wur bad enugh for th' owd woman to tak' her back wom',
but if we tak' her back into th' Church we's be a thaasand times
wur,&rsquo; continued Amos.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But surely,&rsquo; pleaded Mr. Penrose, &lsquo;if the
angels welcome a returning sinner, might we not venture to do the
same?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We're noan angels yet, Mr. Penrose,&rsquo; replied
<a class="pagebreak" name="page149" id="page149" title="149"></a>
Amos. &lsquo;It'll be time enugh to do as th' angels do when we live
as th' angels live; an' I raither think as yo'd clam if yo' were put
o' angels' meat. Ony road, ye con try it if yo' like; it'll save us
summat i' th' offertory if yo' do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come, Amos, thaa's goin' a bit too fur,&rsquo; interrupted
Abraham Lord. &lsquo;If yo're baan to insult th' parson, yo've no
need to insult them as is up aboon&mdash;&ldquo;ministerin'
sperits,&rdquo; as th' apostle cos em.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We know thaa'rt no angel, Amos, baat thi tellin'
us,&rsquo; said Malachi o' th' Mount. &lsquo;And it ever they shap
thee into one thaa'll tak' some tentin!&rsquo; (minding).</p>

<p>&lsquo;I durnd know as I want to be one afore mi time, Malachi:
an' I'm noan baan to do as they do till I ged amang 'em. I'd as soon
pool a warp ony day as play a harp; but when th' Almeety skifts me
fro' th' Brig Factory to heaven, mebbe I'll shap as weel at a bit o'
music as ony on yo'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wilto play thi music o'er sich as Amanda, thinksto?&rsquo;
asked old Malachi.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thee mind thi business, Malachi. When th' Almeety maks me
an angel, I'll do as th'
<a class="pagebreak" name="page150" id="page150" title="150"></a>
angels do. But noan afore, noather for yo', nor Amanda Stott, nor
Mr. Penrose, nor onybody else, so naa thaa knows.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Spokken like a mon,&rsquo; assented Elias Bradshaw.
&lsquo;Stick to thi text, Amos.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And yet, after all,&rsquo; said Dr. Hale, &lsquo;I think
we ought to receive Amanda back again into our communion. The only
One who ever forgave sins drew no line as to their number, nor shade
as to their degree.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But durnd yo' think, doctor, that if we do as yo' want us
we's be turnin' th' Church into a shoddy hoile?&rsquo; asked Elias
Bradshaw.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There are no shoddy souls,&rsquo; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; continued Mr. Penrose; &lsquo;it was not shoddy
that Christ came to seek and save.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who wur it said th' gate were strait and th' road
narro'?&rsquo; cried out an old man who was always known by the name
of &lsquo;Clogs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That's no reason why yo' should want to turn th' gate into
a steele-hoile (stile), is it?&rsquo; retorted Malachi.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gate or steele-hoile, it's narro'; and that's enugh for
me, an' it were noan us ut made it narro'; it wur th' Almeety
Hissel',&rsquo; replied Clogs.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page151" id="page151" title="151"></a>
<p>&lsquo;At any rate, He made it wide enough for Amanda,&rsquo;
said Dr. Hale, &lsquo;and that is the matter we are now
considering.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'm noan so sure o' that, doctor. There's a good bit o'
Scripter agen yo' if yo' come to texes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then so much the worse for Scripture,&rsquo; was the
unguarded, yet honest, retort of Mr. Penrose; and Dr. Hale laid a
kind hand on the young minister's shoulder to restrain his
haste.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It seems to me,&rsquo; said Elias Bradshaw, &lsquo;as Mr.
Penrose spends a deal too mich time in poolin' up the stumps and
makin' th' strait gate into a gap as ony rubbige con go thro'. I
could like to yer him preych fro' the fifteenth verse o' th' last
chapter i' Revelation. I once yerd a grond sarmon fro' that text i'
th' pulpit up aboon here; and when it were oer, Dickey o' Sams o'
the Heights went aat o' th' chapel, and tried to draan hissel' i'
Green Fold Lodge. Naa, that's what I co powerful
preychin'!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pardon me, Mr. Bradshaw. We are not here to discuss the
merits of preaching. We are here to consider the request of Amanda
Stott&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page152" id="page152" title="152"></a>
<p>&lsquo;An' axin' yor pardon, Mr. Penrose, that's whod I wur
comin' to.  I'm noan a fancy talker like yo'. Aw never larned to be,
and I'm noan paid to be. Whod I wur baan to say, if you'll nobbud
let me, wur this: As Jesus Christ wur a deal more particular who He
leet in than who He kept aat. That's all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But who did He keep out?&rsquo; asked Dr. Hale.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Haa mony, thinksto, did He leet in, doctor? I could welly
caant um o' on both mi hands.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It seems to me yo' want to mak' saints as scarce as white
crows,&rsquo; said Abraham Lord.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, Abram; we want to keep th' black 'uns aat o' th'
nests.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then yo' mud as weel fell th' rookery,&rsquo; was
Abraham's sharp retort, which called forth a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I read th' Bible reet,&rsquo; said Amos Entwistle,
returning to the fray, &lsquo;if I read th' Bible reet, a felley
once coome to Jesus Christ an' axed Him if mony or few wur saved;
and all he geet for an answer wur, &ldquo;Thee mind and geet saved
thisel'; it'll tak' thee all thy time wi'out botherin' abaat
others.&rdquo; An' I think it'll tak' us all aar time baat botherin'
abaat Amanda
<a class="pagebreak" name="page153" id="page153" title="153"></a>
Stott. I move as we tak' no more notice on her axin' to come back
amang us. It's geddin' lat, an' my porritch is waitin' for me at
wom'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was more than Mr. Penrose could bear, and rising to his
feet, he asked, in suppressed tones, that the matter under
discussion might receive the care and wisdom and mercy that a soul
demanded from those who held in their hands the shaping of its
earthly destiny; and then, in a voice stifled with emotion, he
ventured to draw the contrast between the last speaker, who would
fain hurry, for the sake of an evening meal, decisions that had to
deal with the peace of a repentant girl, and He who, in the moments
of bodily hunger, putting aside the refreshment brought by His
disciples, said, &lsquo;I have meat to eat that ye know not
of.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nor did Mr. Penrose plead in vain. Those who listened to him were
moved by his words, and Amos Entwistle sat down, to utter no further
word against Amanda.</p>

<p>From this time the tone of the discussion changed. Not that Mr.
Penrose devoutly listened; indeed, he was listless, only recovering
himself, now and again, as some striking
<a class="pagebreak" name="page154" id="page154" title="154"></a>
sentence, or scrap of rude philosophy, fell on his indifferent ear.
Leaning back in his chair, his eye rested on the hard features of
the men sitting on either side of the deacons' table. They were men
of grit, men of the hills, men whose religious ancestry was right
royal. Their fathers had fayed out well the foundations on which the
old chapel stood, and hewn the stones, and reared the walls, and all
for love&mdash;and after the close of hard days of toil. They were
men who knew nothing of moral half-lights&mdash;there were no
gradations in their sense of right and wrong. Sin was sin, and
righteousness was righteousness&mdash;the one night and the other
day.  They drew a line, narrow and inflexible, and knew no debatable
zone where those who lingered were neither sinners nor saints. And
so with the doctrines they held. Severity characterized them.
Justice became cruelty, and faith superstition. They knew nothing of
progressive revelations. The old Sinaitic God still ruled; the
mountain was still terrible, and dark with the clouds of wrath.
Fatherhood in the Deity was an unknown attribute, and tenderness a
note never sounded in the creed they held.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page155" id="page155" title="155"></a>
They had been bred on meat, and they were strong men. They knew
nothing of the tender tones of Him whose feet became the throne of
the outcast. Their God was a consuming fire.</p>

<p>As Mr. Penrose looked into their faces, many bitter thoughts
poisoned the waters of his soul. He thought of Simon the Pharisee;
he thought, too, of St. Dominic; and of Calvin with the cry for
green wood, so that Servetus might slowly burn. He thought, too, of
the curse of spiritual pride&mdash;pride that enthroned men as
judges over the destiny of their fellows, and damned souls as freely
and as coolly as a commander marched his forlorn hope into the
yawning breach. And then, realizing that among such his lot was
thrown&mdash;realizing also the dead hand that rested on his
teaching and preaching&mdash;his heart went down into a sea of
hopelessness, and he felt the chill of despair.</p>

<p>The gong of the chapel clock announced the hour of nine, in thin,
metallic beats, and looking up, he noted the swealing tapers in the
candelabra over his head. In his over-wrought, nervous condition, he
imagined he saw in one of the flickering, far-spent lights the
waning life of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page156" id="page156" title="156"></a>
Amanda Stott, and the horrible thought of eternal extinction at
death laid its cold hand on the larger hope which he was struggling
to keep aflame in his darkening soul.  Turning his glances towards
the pulpit that rose gaunt and square above the deacons' pew, and
over which hung the old sounding-board, as though to mock the
voices, now for ever silent, that from time to time had been wont to
reverberate from its panels, he began to wonder whether the message
the Church called revelation was not, after all, as vain as
&lsquo;laughter over wine&rsquo;; and as he looked on the frowning
galleries and the distant corners of the chapel, gloomy and
fearsome&mdash;the high-backed pews, peopled with shadows thrown
from the waning lights&mdash;he felt the force of the words of one
of his masters: &lsquo;What shadows we are, and what shadows we
pursue.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he was recalled to his position as the pastor of the
church by the voice of old Enoch, mellow as the tones of the flute
on which he so often tuned his soul in moods of sorrow and sin.  How
long Enoch had been talking Mr. Penrose knew not; but what he heard
in the rude yet kindly vernacular of the moors was:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page157" id="page157" title="157"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Let's show mercy, lads! Noan o' us con howd up aar yeds
baat it.  Him as has put us here expects us to show yon lass o'
Stott's same as He's shown to us Hissel'. There's one bit o' readin'
i' th' New Testament as noan o' yo' has had owt to say abaat&mdash;I
mean where th' Lord tells o' th' two debtors. Th' fust geet let off;
but when he wouldn't let his mate off, it were a sore job for him.
Durnd yo' think as th' Almeety cares as mich abaat us as we care for
aar childer? I somehaa thinks He does. Didn't him as played on th'
harp say, &ldquo;Like as a faither pitieth his childer, so th' Lord
pitieth them that fear Him&rdquo;? An' him as said that had a bad
lad an' o'&mdash;an' didn't he say he'd raither ha' deed than th'
lad? Aw welly think as th' Almeety con find room for Amanda, and if
He con, I think we mud be like to thrutch (push) her into Rehoboth.
Let's mak' room for her, hoo'l happen not want it so long; and when
hoo's gone we's noan be sorry we took her in; who knows but what we
shall be takin' in the Lord Hissel? I'm no scholard, but I've read
abaat 'em takin' in angels unawares; and th' Lord said if we took
onybody in ut wur aat
<a class="pagebreak" name="page158" id="page158" title="158"></a>
i' th' cowd, we wur takin' Him in. If we shut Amanda out we's mebbe
shut Him aat, and if He's aatside, them as is inside will be on th'
wrang side. Coome, lads, let's show mercy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There were other voices, however, besides Enoch's, and speakers
as apt at quotation from the Scriptures as he. Indeed, the Bible was
torn into shreds of texts, and&mdash;the letter so re-patched as to
destroy the pattern wrought by its great principles of mercy and
love. The grand words&mdash;righteousness, grace, law, were clashed,
and wildly rung, like sweet bells jangled out of tune, and the court
of souls resembled the vindictiveness of Miltonic demons rather than
the seat of those who claimed to represent Him who said: &lsquo;I
will have mercy and not sacrifice.&rsquo; When the vote was taken
the door was shut against Amanda.</p>

<p>Passing out of the dimly-lighted chapel into the blackness of the
night, Dr. Hale took the arm of the young minister, saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let me guide you, Mr. Penrose. I know these roads by
instinct.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, doctor, I not only need your guidance,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page159" id="page159" title="159"></a>
but that of someone else. Black as the night is, it isn't so black
as the souls of those benighted inquisitors we've left behind us.
There are stars behind those clouds; but there are none hidden
behind the murky creed of the deacons of Rehoboth. Do they expect
me, doctor, to carry their decision to Mrs. Stott and her
daughter?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I believe they do. Hard messages, you know, must be
delivered both by ministers and doctors. It is my lot sometimes to
tell people that their days are numbered, when I would almost as
soon face death myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I have made up my mind, doctor, to face the
resignation of Rehoboth rather than carry their heartless decision
to Amanda.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait until morning, and then come on to my house and
consult with old Mr. Morell; he is staying with me for a day or two.
You never met with him. Perhaps he can guide, or at any rate help
you.  Wisdom lies with the ancients, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But are not the men who have refused admission to Amanda
the spiritual children of Mr. Morell? If his preaching has brought
<a class="pagebreak" name="page160" id="page160" title="160"></a>
about what we have seen and heard to-night, what guidance or help
can I get from him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;I was not thinking
of that. It's true he was pastor here for over forty years, and our
deacons are his spiritual offspring. For all that, the old man's
heart is right if his head is wrong; and, after all, it's the heart
that rules the life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay! no heart could thrive on a creed such as Rehoboth's.
Why, God's heart would grow Jean on it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But Mr. Morell's heart is not lean, Mr. Penrose. It is
not, I assure you,&rsquo; emphasized the doctor, as his companion
uttered a sceptical grunt. &lsquo;He is tenderness incarnate. You
know <i>one</i> good thing came out of Nazareth, despite the
scepticism of the disciple.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Certainly a good thing did come out of Nazareth; but
Nazareth, bad as it was, was not a Calvinistic creed. I very much
question whether the creed of Rehoboth can preserve a tender
heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come and see,&rsquo; laconically replied Dr. Hale.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well, then, I'll treat my scepticism honestly. I will
come and see. To-night the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page161" id="page161" title="161"></a>
hour is too late. I will look in to-morrow morning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose continued his homeward walk, conscious of the first
symptoms of the reaction which follows hours of tension such as
those through which he had just passed. He was limp. Morally as well
as physically his nerve was gone. He thought of the Apostle who
fought with beasts at Ephesus, and envied him his combatants.  His
fretful impatience with those who differed from him theologically
rose to a tide of insane hatred, and he lost himself in a passion
against his deacons as bitter as that which they had shown towards
Amanda Stott and himself.</p>

<p>Entering his lodgings, and lighting his lamp, he threw himself on
the couch, resenting in bitterness of spirit the limitations of
creeds, and the exactions imposed on men who, like himself, were
called to minister to brawling sects. Thrice he sat down at his
desk; thrice he wrote out his resignation, and thrice he committed
it to the flames. Then, recalling the words of an old college
professor who often used to tell his students that the second
Epistle of the Corinthians
<a class="pagebreak" name="page162" id="page162" title="162"></a>
was the ministerial panacea in the hour of depression, he took up
his Testament and read:</p>

<p><i>&lsquo;Ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in
necessities, in distress ... by pureness, by knowledge, by
long-suffering, by kindness, by love unfeigned, by the Holy Ghost,
by the word of truth, by the power of God.&rsquo;</i></p>

<p>And there came on the young pastor a spirit of power, and of
love, and of a new mind, and he slept.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page163" id="page163" title="163"></a>
<a name="chapter3.4" id="chapter3.4"></a>
<h3>IV.</h3><h3>THE OLD PASTOR.</h3>

<p>On the following morning Mr. Penrose set out to call on the old
pastor at the house of Dr. Hale, conjuring up as he went pictures of
the man whom he knew only by report, and, as he deemed, exaggerated
report too. To Rehoboth people Mr. Morell was a prodigy&mdash;a
veritable prophet of the Most High; and his successor's sojourn was
not a little embittered by the disparaging contrasts so frequently
drawn between the old order and the new. To be for ever told the
texts from which Mr. Morell used to preach, to hear in almost every
house some pet saying or scrap of philosophy wont to fall from his
lips, to be asked, if not bidden, by the deacons to tread in the
footprints of one who was believed to wear the seven-league boots,
became intolerable; and had not discretion
<a class="pagebreak" name="page164" id="page164" title="164"></a>
guarded the speech of Mr. Penrose, many a time his language of
retort would have been strange to covenanted lips. Often, too, he
asked himself what manner of man he must be who nursed and reared
this narrow sect of the hills&mdash;a sect setting judgment before
mercy, and law before love&mdash;a sect narrowing salvation to
units, and drawing the limit line of grace around a fragment of
mankind.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Dr. Hale's, however, a surprise greeted him,
and as he responded to the old pastor's outstretched hand, he knew
he met with one in whom firm gentleness and affable dignity were the
chief charm of character. There was not, as he anticipated, coarse,
crass assertiveness&mdash;a semi-cultured man whose narrow creed
joined hands with barren intelligence. Far otherwise; he stood
before one whose presence commanded reverence, one at whose feet he
felt he must bow.</p>

<p>Mr. Morell was tall and erect, with a fine Greek head whose crown
of snowy hair lent dignity to a face sunny with the light of
kindness, while every line of expression, those soul-inscriptions
written by the years on the plastic
<a class="pagebreak" name="page165" id="page165" title="165"></a>
flesh, told of thought and culture. The accent, too, was finished,
and every gesture betrayed refinement and ease.</p>

<p>At first the conversation was restrained, for both men
instinctively felt that between them lay a gulf which it would be
difficult to bridge; but, as Dr. Hale played well the part of
middleman, the ministers were drawn out towards each other, and in a
little while struck mutual chords in one another's hearts.</p>

<p>During the morning the two men talked of art, of philosophy, and
of history, the discussion of these calling out a light of
intelligence and rapture on the old man's face. When, however, the
graver questions of theology were broached, his voice became hard
and inflexible, a shadow fell, and the radiancy of the man and
scholar became lost in the gloom of the divine.</p>

<p>Whenever Mr. Penrose ventured to hint on some phase of the
broader theology, the old man was provoked to impatience; and when
he went so far as to quote Browning, and declare that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="inline">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;The loving worm within its clod</span><br />
<span class="i0">Were diviner than a loveless god</span><br />
<span class="i1">&nbsp; Amid his worlds,&rsquo;</span>
</blockquote>
<a class="pagebreak" name="page166" id="page166" title="166"></a>
<p><ins class="correction"
title="Note: this word was not inked in the source copy.">a</ins>
gleam of fire shot from the mild eye of Mr. Morell, significant
as a storm-signal across a sea of glass.</p>

<p>The younger man was often taken at disadvantage, for, while he
was in touch with modern thought, he did not possess the old
dialectician's skill. Once, as Mr. Penrose remarked that science was
modifying theology, Mr. Morell, detecting the flaw in his armour,
thrust in his lance to the hilt by replying that science and
Calvinism were logically the same, with the exception that, for
heredity and environment, the Calvinist introduced grace.</p>

<p>Whereupon Mr. Penrose cried with some vehemence:</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, no, Mr. Morell! that will not do. I cannot accept your
statement at all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can't you?&rsquo; said the old man, rising from his chair,
the war spirit hardening his voice and flaming in his eye.
&lsquo;Can't you?  What says science of the first hundred men which
will pass you, if you take your stand in the main thoroughfare of
the great city over the hills yonder? Watch them; one is drunk,
another is linked arm in arm with his paramour, a third is
handcuffed,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page167" id="page167" title="167"></a>
and you can see by the conduct of him who follows that he is as
reckless of life as though the years were for ever. Why these? Ask
science, and it answers <i>election</i>&mdash;the election of birth
and circumstance.  Ask Calvinism, and it, too, answers
election&mdash;the election of decrees.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But science does not do away with will, Mr.
Morell.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, then, it teaches its impotence, and that is the same
thing.  It bases will on organization, and traces conduct to
material sources. Huxley tells us the salvation of a child is to be
born with a sound digestion, and Calvinism says the salvation of a
child is to be born under the election of grace. Logically, the
basis of both systems is the same; the sources of life differ, that
is all. One traces from matter, the other from mind&mdash;from the
mind and will of the Eternal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But science fixes it for earth only&mdash;you fix it for
eternity,&rsquo; suggestively hinted the younger man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, you are right, Mr. Penrose; we do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then a man is lost because he cannot be
<a class="pagebreak" name="page168" id="page168" title="168"></a>
saved, and punished for things over which he had no
control?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ask science,&rsquo; was the curt reply.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, Mr. Morell, I will ask science, and science will
yield hope. Science says, take a hundred men and a hundred women,
and let them live on a fruitful island and multiply, and in four
generations you will have an improved stock&mdash;a stock freer from
atavism, hysteria, anomalies, and insanities. Science holds out
hope; you don't. You say God's will and decrees are eternal, and
what they were a thousand ages since they will be a thousand ages to
come. Science does eventually point to a new heaven and new earth,
but Calvinism throws no light across the gloom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old man quietly shifted his ground by asking his opponent if
he ever asked himself why he did, and why he did not, do certain
things.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose the reason is because of my choice, is it
not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what governs choice&mdash;or, if you like,
will?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do, myself.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page169" id="page169" title="169"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Who are you, and what part of you governs it? Will cannot
govern Will, can it? And can you divorce will from
personality?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tennyson answers your question, Mr. Morell.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">
&lsquo;&ldquo;Our wills are ours, we know not how,&rdquo;
</blockquote>
<p>that is the mystery of existence.</p>
<blockquote class="inline">
&lsquo;&ldquo;Our wills are ours, to make them Thine,&rdquo;
</blockquote>
<p>that is the mystery of salvation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then, Mr. Penrose, I ask you&mdash;why don't we make our
wills God's?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose was silent, and then he made a slip, and played into
his opponent's hands by saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;My faith in a final restitution meets that difficulty. We
shall all be God's some time; His love is bound to
conquer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Suppose what you call Will defies God's love, what
then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It cannot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then it is no longer will.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Cannot you conceive of Will winning Will?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page170" id="page170" title="170"></a>
<p>&lsquo;I can conceive of Will, as you define it, defying Will,
and that for ever. But we escape your contradictions; we accept the
fact that some men are under a Divine control they cannot
resist&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you both agree as to the principle,&rsquo; broke in
Dr. Hale; &lsquo;you are both Calvinists, with this difference: you,
Mr. Morell, say only the few will be called; Mr. Penrose, here, says
all will be called. Let us go in for the larger hope.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are right, doctor. I am a Calvinistic
Universalist,&rsquo; cried Mr. Penrose in triumph.</p>

<p>And Mr. Morell was bound to admit the doctor had scored.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before Mr. Penrose found a spring of
tenderness hidden beneath the crust of Calvinism that lay around the
old man's soul, and on which were written in fiery characters the
terrors of a merciless law. And the rod that smote this rock and
tapped the spring was none other than the story of Amanda's return
and repentance, told in part by Dr. Hale and in part by the young
pastor himself.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page171" id="page171" title="171"></a>
<p>As the story was unfolded, the old man evinced much feeling,
often raising his hand to shade fast-filling eyes, or to brush away
the tears that fell down his furrowed face. They told him of
Amanda's silence as to the past, and he commended her for it,
remarking to Mr. Penrose that the true penitent seldom talked of the
yesterdays of sin; they told him how she counted herself unworthy of
home and of love, seeking blame and not welcome from the mother to
whom she had returned, and he declared it to be a token of her call;
they told him of the great light and peace that fell on her as she
rested on the goodness of God, and they heard from him the echo of
his Master's words over Mary&mdash;&lsquo;She hath loved much, for
she hath had much forgiven&rsquo;; and then they told him of her
desire for the restoration of her name on the Rehoboth register, and
he was silent&mdash;and for some minutes no sound disturbed his
reverie.</p>

<p>That silence was God's speaking hour. Within the old pastor's
soul a voice was whispering before which the thunderings of the
creed of a sect were hushed. He, poor man, knew full
<a class="pagebreak" name="page172" id="page172" title="172"></a>
well that it was a voice which had long striven to make itself
heard&mdash;a still, small voice that would neither strive nor
cry&mdash;a haunting voice, a voice constant in its companionship
during his later years. How often he would fain have listened to it!
But he dared not, for was it not a contradictory voice? Did it not
traverse the letter which he had sworn to uphold and declare? What
if the voice were the voice of God? No! It could not be. God spoke
in His Book. It was plain.  Wayfaring men might read, and fools had
no need to err. But was God's voice for ever hushed? Had He had no
message since the seal was fixed to the Canon of Scripture? What if
that which he heard was one of those messages concerning which
Christ said, &lsquo;I have many things to say unto you, but ye
cannot bear them now.&rsquo; Had the <i>now</i> in his life passed?
Had the <i>then</i> come when a fuller revelation was about to be
vouchsafed? Nay! even the Apostle&mdash;the man inspired&mdash;only
knew in part. Why should he, then, try to pry into the clouds and
darkness that were round about the awful throne? And yet in Him who
sat on that throne was no
<a class="pagebreak" name="page173" id="page173" title="173"></a>
darkness at all. Supposing the feelings struggling in his heart now
were rays of light from Him&mdash;rays seeking to pierce the clouds,
and bring more truth&mdash;truth which, in his highest moments, he
had dreamed of, but never dared to follow. Was not Dr. Hale right
after all?  Was it not better to trust what we knew to be best in
us, and follow the larger rather than the lesser hope?</p>

<p>And so, in the silence, the two voices reasoned in the soul of
Mr.  Morell.</p>

<p>In a little while Mr. Morell, roused from his reverie, turned to
the young pastor, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your poet is right, Mr. Penrose. The loving worm within
its clod is diviner than a loveless god amid his worlds. Let us go
as far as the chapel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As they walked along the narrow, winding roadways, broken by
projecting gables, and fenced by irregular rows of palisades, the
old pastor began to re-live the long-departed days. Objects, once
familiar, on which his eye again rested, restored faded and
forgotten colours, and opened page after page in the books of the
past. Many cottages mutely welcomed him,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page174" id="page174" title="174"></a>
their time-stained walls memorials of generations with whom he held
sacred associations.  There was the Old Fold Farm, with its famous
fruit-trees, on which, in spring evenings, he used to watch the
blanching blossoms blush beneath the glowing caress of the setting
sun; and Alice o' th' Nook's garden, with its beds of camomile, the
scent of which brought back, as perfumes are wont to, forms and
faces long since summoned by the &lsquo;mystic vanishers.&rsquo;
There, too, stood the old manse&mdash;now tenantless&mdash;so long
the temple of his studies and domesticities, the shrine of joys and
sorrows known to none save himself. How the history of a life lay
hidden there, each wall scored with fateful characters, decipherable
only to the eye of him who for so many ears sought the shelter which
they gave.</p>

<p>On the summit of the hill in front of him was the chapel, its
sagging roof silhouetted against the blue of the morning sky, the
tombstones, irregular and rude, rising from the billowy sea of
grave-mounds that lay around their base. Beyond him, in grandly
distant sweeps, rose the moors. How well he knew all their contours,
their histories, their names! How familiar he
<a class="pagebreak" name="page175" id="page175" title="175"></a>
used to be with all their moods&mdash;moods sombre and
gladsome&mdash;as now they were capped with mist, now radiant in
sunlight, their sweeps dappled with cloud shadows, moving or
motionless, or white in the broad eye of day. Thus it was, within
the distance of a half-mile walk, his past life, like an open
scroll, lay before him; and he remarked to Mr. Penrose that he had
that morning found the book of memory to be a book of life and a
book of judgment also.</p>

<p>As the three men passed through the chapel-gates they were met by
old Joseph, who was hearty in his welcome of Mr. Morell.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Eh! Mr. Morell,&rsquo; he said, grasping his hand in a
hard and earthy palm, &lsquo;aw'm some fain to see yo'. We've hed no
gradely preachin' sin yo' left Rehoboth. This lad here,&rsquo;
pointing to Mr. Penrose, &lsquo;giz us a twothree crumbs betimes;
but some on us, I con tell yo', are fair clamming for th' bread o'
life. None o' yo'r hawve-kneyded duf (dough), nor your hawve-baked
cakes, wi' a pinch o' currants to fotch th' fancy tooth o' th' young
uns. Nowe, but gradely bread, yo' know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Morell tried to check the brutal volubility
<a class="pagebreak" name="page176" id="page176" title="176"></a>
and plain-spokenness of Joseph, but in vain. He continued the more
vehemently.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's all luv naa, and no law. What mak' o' a gospel dun
yo' co it when there's no law, no thunerins (thunderings), Mr.
Morell, no leetnins? What's th' use o' a gospel wi'out law? No more
use nor a chip i' porritch. Dun yo' remember that sarmon yo' once
preached fro' &ldquo;Jacob have I luved, but Esau have I
hated&rdquo;? It wur a grand un, and Owd Harry o' th' Brig went
straight aat o' th' chapel to th' George and Dragon and geet drunk,
'cose, as he said, he mud as well ged drunk if he wor baan to be
damned, as be damned for naught. Amos Entwistle talks abaat that
sarmon naa, and tells bits on it o'er to th' childer i' th'
catechism class, and then maks 'em ged it off by heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>How long old Joseph would have continued in this strain it is
hard to say, had not Mr. Morell, who did not seem to care to hear
more of his pulpit deliverance of other days, silenced him by
demanding the vestry keys.</p>

<p>As the three men entered the vestry a close, damp atmosphere
smote them&mdash;an atmosphere
<a class="pagebreak" name="page177" id="page177" title="177"></a>
pervading all rooms long shut up from air, and with foundations fed
by fattened graves.</p>

<p>Nor was the vestry itself more inviting. Gloomy and low-ceiled,
the plaster of its walls, soddened and discoloured from the moisture
of the moors, lay peeling off in ragged strips, while its oozing
floor of flags seemed to tell of sweating corpses in their narrow
beds beneath.</p>

<p>Through a small window, across which a spider had woven its web,
a shaft of sunlight lay tremulous with the dance of multitudinous
motes; and, falling on the dust-covered table, lighted up with its
halo a corroded pen and stained stone jar, half filled with
congealed ink.</p>

<p>On the right of this window stood a cupboard, with its panels of
dark oak, behind which lay the parchments and papers of the Rehoboth
Church&mdash;parchments and papers whose inscriptions were fast
fading, whose textures were fast rotting&mdash;companioning in their
decay the decay of the creeds they sought to preserve and
proclaim.</p>

<p>It was to this cupboard Mr. Morell turned, taking therefrom two
time-stained, leather-bound volumes&mdash;the one a record of the
interments of the past hundred years, the other containing the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page178" id="page178" title="178"></a>
roll of Rehoboth communicants since the establishment of the Church.
Laying the former aside, he took up the latter with a tenderness and
devoutness becoming one who was touching the sacred books of some
fetish of the East. It was, indeed, to him a book to be reverenced;
and as he slowly and sadly turned over its time-stained pages, his
eye rested on many names entered in his own small
handwriting&mdash;names which carried him back to companionship with
lives for ever past. Some he had known from birth to death, blessing
them in their advent, and committing them at the grave to Him who is
the sure and certain hope. There were those, too, whom he piloted
along the rocky coasts of youth&mdash;those with whom he once wept
in their shadowed homes, and from whom he never withheld his joy in
their hour of triumph. As name after name met his eye, it was as
though he travelled the streets of a ruined city&mdash;a city with
which in the days of its glory he had been familiar.
Memories&mdash;nothing but memories&mdash;greeted him. He heard
voices, but they were silent; he saw forms, but they were
shadowy.</p>

<p>As he turned over page after page he read as
<a class="pagebreak" name="page179" id="page179" title="179"></a>
never before the record of his half-century's pastorate&mdash;his
moorland ministry among an ever-changing people, and there passed
before him the pageant of a life&mdash;not loud in blare, nor
brilliant in colour&mdash;but sombre, stately, and true.</p>

<p>Continuing to turn over the pages, he came to where a black line
was drawn across the name of Amanda Stott, and where against the
cancelled name a word was written as black as the ink with which it
was inscribed.</p>

<p>Again there came a pause. Long and tearfully the old pastor
looked at that name disfigured, as she, too, who bore it had been,
by the hand of man. Then, taking up the corroded pen and filling it,
he re-wrote the name in the space between the narrow blue-ruled
lines, and, looking up with smiling face, said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yet there is room.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the shaft of sunlight that fell in through the cobwebbed
window of the Rehoboth vestry lay on the newly-inscribed name, as
though heaven sealed with her assent the act of the old man who felt
himself the servant of the One who said, &lsquo;I will in no wise
cast out.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page180" id="page180" title="180"></a>
<a class="pagebreak" name="page181" id="page181" title="181"></a>

<h2>IV.</h2><h2>SAVED AS BY FIRE</h2>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page182" id="page182" title="182"></a>
<a class="pagebreak" name="page183" id="page183" title="183"></a>
<p>It was a narrow, gloomy yard, paved with rough flags dinted and
worn by the wheels of traffic and the tread of many feet. On one
side stood the factory, cheerless and gray, with its storied
heights, and long rows of windows that on summer evenings flamed
with the reflected caresses of the setting sun, and in the shorter
days of winter threw the light of their illuminated rooms like
beacon fires across the miles of moor. Flanking the factory were
sheds and outbuildings and warehouses, through the open doors of
which were seen skips and trollies and warps, and piles of cloth
pieces ready for the market in the great city beyond the hills.
Within a stone's-throw the sluggish river crept along its
blackened bed, no longer a stream fresh from
<a class="pagebreak" name="page184" id="page184" title="184"></a>
the hills, but foul with the service of selfish man.</p>

<p>It was breakfast hour, and the monotonous roar of machinery was
hushed, no longer filling the air with the pulsations of mighty
manufacture. The thud of the ponderous engines had ceased; the
deafening rattle of the looms was no more heard; a myriad spooming
spindles were at rest. A dreamy sound of falling waters floated from
the weir, and the song of birds in a clump of stunted trees made
music in the quiet of the morning light&mdash;it was Nature's chance
to teach man in one of the brief pauses of his toil, had he
possessed the ear to hearken or the heart to understand.</p>

<p>Beneath the shelter of a &lsquo;lean-to&rsquo; a group of men
sat, hurriedly gulping their morning meal, finding time, all the
same, for loud talk and noisy chaff. They were prosaic, hard-faced
men, with lines drawn deeply beneath their eyes, and complexions
sallow, despite the breezes of the hills among which they were
reared.  From childhood they had been the slaves of labour; the
bread they ate was earned by sweat and sorrow, while their spare
hours were given to
<a class="pagebreak" name="page185" id="page185" title="185"></a>
boisterous mirth&mdash;the rebound of exacting toil. Two or three
were conning the betting news in a halfpenny paper of the previous
evening, and talking familiarly of the chances of the favourites,
while others disputed as to sentiments delivered in the last great
political speech.</p>

<p>In one corner sat Amos Entwistle, the butt of not a little mirth
from a half-dozen sceptics who had gathered round him. They
addressed him as &lsquo;Owd Brimstone,&rsquo; and made a burlesque
of his Calvinistic faith, one going so far as to call him &lsquo;a
glory bird,&rsquo; while another declared he was &lsquo;booked for
heaven fust-class baat payin' for his ticket.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why should he pay for his ticket,&rsquo; asked an
impudent-looking youth, &lsquo;when th' Almeety's gan it him? Th'
elect awlus travels for naught, durnd they, Amos?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa's more Scripture larning abaat thee nor I thought
thaa had,&rsquo; said Amos, withdrawing his wrinkled face from the
depths of a can out of which he was drinking tea. &lsquo;But it's
noan knowledge 'at saves, Dan; th' devils believe and
tremble.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I noan tremble, Amos; I geet too mich
<a class="pagebreak" name="page186" id="page186" title="186"></a>
brimstone i' yon fire hoile to be flayed at what yo' say is
&ldquo;resarved&rdquo; for them as isn't called.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(Dan's occupation was to feed the boiler fires.)</p>

<p>&lsquo;If thaa'rt noan flayed, that doesn't say thaa hasn't a
devil,&rsquo; replied Amos, again raising the can to his lips.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I'm noan to blame if a' cornd help miself, am
I?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Amos remained silent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw say, Amos,&rsquo; said a thoughtful-looking man,
&lsquo;aw often wonder if thaa'll be content when thaa geets up
aboon to see us lot in t'other shop.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi! and when we ax him, as th' rich mon axed Lazarus, for
a sooap (drink) of summat cool, it'll be hard lines, wirnd (will
not) it, owd lad, when thaa cornd help us?&rsquo; asked the man who
sat against him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Happen it will,&rsquo; replied Amos. &lsquo;But thaa knows
there'll be no sharin' baggin (tea or refreshment) there. Them as
hed oil couldn't gi' it to them as hed noan.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then thaa'll not come across the gulf and help us,
Amos?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page187" id="page187" title="187"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Nowe!&rsquo; cried Dan. &lsquo;He'd brun (burn) his wings
if he did.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And at this all laughed, save the thoughtful man who put the
first question to the old Calvinist.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa knows, Amos,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I look at it i'
this way. Supposin' th' factory geet o' fire this mornin', an' yo'
hed th' chance o' savin' that lass o' mine that back-tents for yo',
yo'd save her, wouldn't yo'?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lad, if I'd th' <i>chance</i>,&rsquo; replied
Amos.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then haa is it yo're so mich better nor Him, as yo' co th'
Almeety, for yo' reckon He'll noan save some o' us?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I tell thee I'd save th' lass if I hed th' chance. We con
nobbud do what we're permitted to do. We're only instruments in th'
Almeety's honds.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But isn't th' Almeety His own Measter?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;So He is, but His ways are past findin' out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' thaa means to say thaa'd save my lass, and th' Almeety
wouldn't save me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's decrees, thaa knows, lad, it's decrees,&rsquo; said
Amos, unshaken by the argument of his friend.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page188" id="page188" title="188"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Then there's summat wrang with th' decrees, that's all,
Amos.  There's been a mistak' somewhere.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hooist, lad! hooist! durnd talk like that. Woe to th' mon
that strives wi' his Maker.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If thi Maker's th' mon thaa maks Him aat to be, I'm noan
partic'lar abaat oather His woes or His blessin's.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No more am I,&rsquo; cried Dan, as he stood up and
stretched himself with a yawn. &lsquo;We mud as well mak' most o'
life if we're booked for t'other shop, though mine's a warm un i'
this world, as yo' all know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but
of God that showeth mercy,&rsquo; said Amos, in solemn tones.</p>

<p>And the whistle sounded for the renewal of work, and the men
dispersed.</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>The clock in the factory yard pointed to the hour of ten, and
four hundred toilers were sweating out their lives in one of
Manufacture's minting-shops of wealth. Overhead the shafting ran in
rapid revolutions, communicating its power and speed by lengths of
swaying, sagging
<a class="pagebreak" name="page189" id="page189" title="189"></a>
belts to the machinery that stood so closely packed on the vibrating
floors, and between which passed, and behind which stood, the
operatives, unconscious of danger, and with scarce a care than how
to keep pace with the speed of steam and the flying hours. Every eye
was strained, and every nerve as highly strung as the gearing of the
revolving wheels, the keen glances of the overlookers seeing to it
that none paused until the hour of release.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was heavy, the temperature high, and flecks of
&lsquo;fly&rsquo; floated on the stifling air, wafted by the breath
born of whirring wheels, and finding rest on the hair of women and
the beards of men until the workers looked as though they were
whitened by the snows of a premature decay.</p>

<p>Women and girls sang snatches of songs, and bits of old familiar
airs, with no accompaniment but the roar and rattle around, their
voices unheard save when some high-pitched note was struck; and
others found odd moments when by lip-signs and dumb show they
communicated with their fellow-workers.</p>

<p>Men and women, boys and girls, passed and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page190" id="page190" title="190"></a>
repassed one another in narrow alleys and between revolving
machinery, crushing together without sense of decency, and
whispering hastily in one another's ear some lewd joke or impure
word, the moisture from their warm flesh mingling with the smell of
oil and cotton, and their semi-nude forms offering pictures for the
realistic pen of a Zola or a Moore.</p>

<p>It was but one of the laps in the great race of competition where
steam contends with human breath, and iron is pitted against flesh
and blood. Over the hills were other factories where the same race
was going on, where other masters were competing, and other hands
were laying down life that they themselves and their little ones
might live&mdash;examples of the strange paradox that only those can
save their lives who lose them. Outside was pasturage and moorlands,
and the dear, sweet breath of heaven, the flowers of the field, the
song of birds, the yearning bosom of Nature warm with love towards
her children. Yet here, within, was a reeking house of
flesh&mdash;not the lazar ward of the city slum, but the sweating
den of a competitive age.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page191" id="page191" title="191"></a>
<p>In the top story of the factory Amos was walking to and fro among
his roving frames, and dividing his time between hurried glances at
his workers and a small greasy tract he held in his hand, entitled
&lsquo;An Everlasting Task for Arminians.&rsquo; Turning aside for a
moment to drive some weary operative with a word as rough as a
driver uses to his over-driven horse, he would return to the
&lsquo;Everlasting Task,&rsquo; and cull some choice sentence or
read some twisted text used to buttress up the Calvinistic creed.
Reading aloud to himself the words&mdash;&lsquo;Real Christian
charity is swallowed up in the Will of God, nor is it in its nature
to extend itself one step beyond, nor desire one thing contrary to,
the glory of Jehovah. All the charity we possess beyond this may be
properly called fleshly charity&rsquo;&mdash;he lifted his eyes to
see two of his &lsquo;back-tenters&rsquo; playing behind the frames,
and his real Christian charity displayed itself in pulling their
ears until they tingled and bled, and in freely using his feet in
sundry kicks on their shins. And yet, wherein was this man to blame?
Was he not what commerce and Calvinism had made him?</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page192" id="page192" title="192"></a>
<p>The finger of the clock in the factory yard was creeping towards
the hour of eleven, when a smell, ominous to every old factory hand,
was borne into the nostrils of Amos. In a moment his
&lsquo;Everlasting Task&rsquo; was thrust into his shirt-breast, and
he ran towards the door from which the stairway of the room
descended.</p>

<p>No, he was not mistaken, the smell was the smell of fire, and
scarcely had he gone down a half-dozen steps before he met a man
with blanched face, who barely found breath to say:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Th' scutchin' room's ablaze.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Amos carried a cool head. His religion had done one thing for
him: it had made him a fatalist, and fatalists are
self-contained.</p>

<p>In a moment he took in the whole situation. He knew that the
stairways would act as a huge draught, up which the flames from the
room below would bellow and blaze. He knew, too, that all way of
escape being cut off below, screaming women and girls, maddened with
fright, would rush to the topmost room of the mill, where probably
they would become a holocaust to commerce. He knew, too, that those
who sought the windows and let themselves
<a class="pagebreak" name="page193" id="page193" title="193"></a>
down by ropes and warps would lose their presence of mind, and
probably fall mangled and broken on the flag floor of the yard,
sixty or seventy feet below. All this passed through his mind ere
the old watch in his fob had marked the lapse of five seconds.</p>

<p>In a moment his resolve was taken. He went back to the
roving-room with steady step, and a face as calm as though he were
standing in the light of a summer sun. By the time he reached the
room the machinery was beginning to slow down, and a mad stampede
was being made by the hands towards the door.</p>

<p>Raising his arm, he cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go back, lasses; there's no gate daan theer. Them of us as
'as to be brunt will be brunt, and them of us as is to escape will
ged off wi' our lives. Keep cool, lasses; we'll do our best; and
remember 'at th' Almeety rules.&rsquo;</p>

<p>One thing turned out in the favour of Amos and of his rovers. The
mad rush from below poured into the room under him, and not, as he
expected, into his own, the lower room being one where there was a
better chance of escape. Seeing this, he barred up his own
<a class="pagebreak" name="page194" id="page194" title="194"></a>
doorway to prevent the girls and women swarming below, where they
would have made confusion worse confounded. Then he beat out one of
the windows, and proceeded to fix and lower a rope by way of
escape.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now then, lasses,&rsquo; said he, having rapidly completed
his task, &lsquo;th' little uns fust,&rsquo; and in a moment a girl
of twelve was swinging seventy feet in the air, while a crowd of
roaring humanity below held its breath, and gazed with dilating eyes
on the child who hung between life and death. In a minute more the
spell of silence broke, and a roar, louder than before, told that
the little one had touched earth without injury, save hands all raw
from friction with the rope along which she had slidden.</p>

<p>Child after child followed; then the women were taken in their
turn, and lowered safely into the factory yard.</p>

<p>By the time it came to the turn of Amos, the roar of the fire
sounded like the distant beating of many seas along a rock-bound
coast. The hot breath was ascending, and thin tongues of flame began
to shoot through the floor of the room where he stood. The pungent
smell
<a class="pagebreak" name="page195" id="page195" title="195"></a>
of burnt cotton stung his nostrils and blinded his eyes with pain,
and the atmosphere was fevered to such a degree that with difficulty
he drew his breath.</p>

<p>His turn had come, but was he the last in the room? Something
told him that he was not, that he must look round and satisfy
himself, otherwise his duty was unfulfilled.</p>

<p>The tongues of flame became fiercer; he saw them running along
the joints of the boarding, and feeding on the oil and waste which
had accumulated there for years. He felt his hour was come. But he
was calm. God ruled. No mistake could be made by the
Almighty&mdash;nor could any mistake be made by himself, for was he
not under Divine guidance?</p>

<p>Calmly he walked along the length of the room, stepping aside to
escape the flame, and searching behind each roving-frame in his
walk, as though to assure himself that no one remained unsaved.</p>

<p>Coming to the last frame, he saw the fainting form of one of his
back-tenters, the very child whose ears he had so savagely pulled
but an hour before.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page196" id="page196" title="196"></a>
<p>There she lay, with her pallid, pinched face across her arm, the
flames creeping towards her as though greedy to feed themselves on
her young life.</p>

<p>In an instant Amos stepped towards the child and raised her in
his arms, intending to return to the window and so seek escape. He
was too late, however; a wall of fire stretched across the room, and
he felt the floor yielding beneath his feet.</p>

<p>He was still calm and self-contained. He thought of Him who was
said to dwell in devouring flames, and was Himself a consuming fire.
He thought of the three Hebrew youths and the sevenfold-heated
furnace. He thought of the One who was the wall of fire to His
people, and he was not afraid.</p>

<p>On swept the blaze. In a few moments he knew the roof must follow
the fast-consuming floor. Still he was calm. He stepped on to one of
the stone sills to secure a moment's respite, and he cried in an
unfaltering voice, &lsquo;The Lord reigneth. Let His will be
done.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Frantic efforts were being made by the crowd below to recall
Amos, who had been seen to disappear
<a class="pagebreak" name="page197" id="page197" title="197"></a>
from the window into the room. His name was shouted in wild and
entreating cries, and men reared ladders, only to find them too
short, while women threw up their arms and fell fainting in
excitement on the ground.</p>

<p>On swept the flame. Still Amos held his own on the stone ledge.
Grand was his demeanour&mdash;erect, despite his seventy years,
clasping with a death grip the fainting child. All around him was
smoke and mingling fire; but the Lord reigned&mdash;what He willed
was right; in Him was no darkness at all.</p>

<p>Suddenly he lifted his eyes, and saw above him a manhole that led
into the roof. In a moment he sprang along the frames, and passed in
with his burden, and beat his way through the slates which in
another minute were to fall in with the final collapse of the old
factory.</p>

<p>Creeping along the ridge, he made his way towards the great
chimney-shaft that ran up at one end of the building, and bidding
the girl, who by contact with the air was now conscious, cling to
his neck, the old man laid hold of the lightning-rod, and began his
dangerous descent to the ground.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page198" id="page198" title="198"></a>
<p>But he knew no fear; there was no tremor in his muscles; steadily
he descended, feeling that God held his hands, and he told his
Rehoboth friends afterwards, when he recounted his escape, that he
felt the angels were descending with him.</p>

<p>When he reached the ground amid wild and passionate cries of joy,
he disengaged the child from his neck, and wiping his face with the
sleeve of his shirt, said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Lord's will be done.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Hale, who was standing by the side of Mr. Penrose, and who
heard the saying of old Amos, turned and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Calvinism grows strong men, does it not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, doctor, yo're reet,&rsquo; exclaimed old Joseph;
&lsquo;theer's no stonning agen God's will.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>I.</h3><h3>THE CANDLE OF THE LORD.</h3>

<p>Through the summer months the old Bridge Factory stood in ruins;
the only part that remained intact being the tall chimney-shaft,
down which Amos Entwistle had brought the fainting child from out
the flames. The days were long and the weather warm, and the
inhabitants of Rehoboth spent the sunny hours in wandering over the
moors, never dreaming of hard times and the closing year. A few of
the more frugal and thrifty families had secured employment in a
neighbouring valley, returning home at the week end. The many,
however, awaited the rebuilding of the mill and the recommencement
of work at their old haunt. But when the autumn set in chill and
drear, and the October rains swept the trees and soaked the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page202" id="page202" title="202"></a>
grass&mdash;when damp airs hung over the moors morning by morning,
and returned to spread their chill canopy at eventide&mdash;faces
began to wear an anxious look, and hearts lost the buoyancy of the
idle summer hours.</p>

<p>There is always desolation in the late autumn on the moors. The
great hills lose their bold contours, now dying away in a cold gray
of sky, through which a blurred sun sheds his watery ray; while the
bracken, with its beaten fronds, and the heather with its
disenchanted bloom, change the gorgeous carpet of colour into wastes
and wilds of cheerless expanse. The wind sobs as though conscious of
the coming winter's stress&mdash;sad with its prophecy of want, and
cold, and decay. Little rivulets that ran gleaming like silver
threads&mdash;the Pactolian streams of childhood's home and lover's
whisperings&mdash;now swell and deepen and complain, as though angry
with the burdens of the falling clouds. Bared branches and
low-browed eaves weep with the darkened and lowering sky, and
withered leaves beat piteously at the cottage windows they once
shadowed with their greenery, or lie limp and clayey on the roadside
and the path. Then, in
<a class="pagebreak" name="page203" id="page203" title="203"></a>
the silent night, there falls the first rime, and in the morning is
seen the hoary covering that tells of the year's ageing and
declining days. At the corner of the village street the hoarse cough
is heard, and around the hearth the children gather closely, no
longer sporting amid the flowers, or peopling the cloughs with fairy
homes. A dispiriting hand tones down the great orchestra of Nature,
and all her music is set to a minor key, her &lsquo;Jubilate&rsquo;
becoming a threnody&mdash;a great preludious sob.</p>

<p>It was in autumn hours such as these&mdash;and only too well
known in Rehoboth&mdash;that old Mr. Morell used to discourse on the
fading leaf, and tell of a harvest past and a summer ended, and bid
his flock so number their days that they might apply their hearts
unto wisdom. It was now, too, that the dark procession used to creep
more frequently up the winding path to the Rehoboth grave-yard, and
the heavy soil open oftener beneath old Joseph's spade, and the
voice of the minister in deeper and more measured tones repeat the
words, &lsquo;We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain
we can carry nothing out.&rsquo; It was now also that the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page204" id="page204" title="204"></a>
feeble and the aged shunned the darkening shadows of the streets,
and crept and cowered over the kindling hearth in the sheltered
home. In Rehoboth October and November were ever drear; and now that
the old Bridge Factory was in ruins, and work scarce and food scant,
the minds of the people were overcast with what threatened to be the
winter of a discontent.</p>

<p>On an afternoon in mid-November, Mr. Penrose forsook his study
for what he hoped might be an exhilarating walk across the gloomy
moors. The snow&mdash;the first snow&mdash;was beginning to descend,
gently and lazily, in pure, feathery flakes, remaining on earth for
a moment, and then merging its crystals into the moisture that lay
along the village street.</p>

<p>Turning a corner, he met Dr. Hale, who, after a hearty greeting,
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is this I hear about your resignation, Mr.
Penrose?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don't know what you've heard, doctor, but I am
resigning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense! Running away from ignorance, eh? What would you
say if I ran away from disease?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page205" id="page205" title="205"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Canst thou minister to a mind diseased?&rsquo; was Mr.
Penrose's sharp retort.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I cannot. But you can, and it's your duty to do
so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You're mistaken, doctor. I cannot go to the root of the
moral disease of Rehoboth. If it were drink, or profligacy, or
greed, I might; but self-righteousness beat Jesus, and no wonder it
beats me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Taking Mr. Penrose by the arm, Dr. Hale said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You see that falling snow. Why does it disappear as soon
as it touches earth?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because the earth is higher in temperature than the snow,
and therefore melts it,&rsquo; replied the young man, wondering at
the sudden change in the conversation.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And if it keeps on falling for another hour, why will it
cease to disappear? Why will it remain?&rsquo; continued the
doctor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because its constant falling will so cool the earth that
the earth will no longer melt it,&rsquo; said Mr. Penrose, growing
impatient with his examination in the rudiments of science.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well said, my friend. And therein lies a
<a class="pagebreak" name="page206" id="page206" title="206"></a>
parable. You think your teaching falls to disappear. No; it falls to
prepare. You must continue to let it fall, and finally it will
remain, and lodge itself in the minds of your people. There, now, I
have given you one of the treasures of the snow. But here's old
Moses.  Good-morning, Mr. Fletcher; busy as usual?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, doctor, aw'm findin' these clamming fowk a bit o'
brass.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How's that, Moses?&rsquo; asked the minister.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, yo' know as weel as aw do, Mr. Penrose. Sin' I yerd
yo' talk abaat Him as gies liberally, I thought aw'd do a bit on mi
own accaant.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There, now,&rsquo; said Dr. Hale, &lsquo;the snow is
beginning to stay, is it not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>As the doctor and Moses said &lsquo;Good-day,&rsquo; the pastor
continued his walk in a brooding mood, scarce lifting his head from
the ground, on which the flakes were falling more thickly and
beginning to remain. Lost in thought, and continuing his way towards
the end of the village, he was startled by a tapping at the window
of Abraham Lord's cottage, and, looking up, he saw Milly's beckoning
hand.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page207" id="page207" title="207"></a>
<p>Passing up the garden-path and entering the kitchen, he bade the
girl a good-afternoon, and asked her if she were waiting for the
&lsquo;angel een.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Milly; &lsquo;I'm baan to be content wi'
th' daawn (down) off their wings to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;So you call the snow &ldquo;angels' down,&rdquo; do
you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ey, Mr. Penrose,&rsquo; cried her mother. &lsquo;Hoo's
names for everythin' yo' can think on. Hoo seed a great sunbeam on a
bank of white claads t' other day, and hoo said hoo thought it were
God Hissel', because th' owd Book said as He made th' clouds His
chariot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But why do you call the snow &ldquo;angels' down,&rdquo;
Milly?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, it's i' this way, Mr. Penrose,&rsquo; replied the
girl. &lsquo;I've sin th' birds pool th' daawn off their breasts to
line th' nest for their young uns. And why shouldn't th' angels do
th' same for us?  Mi faither says as haa snow is th' earth's
lappin', and keeps all th' seeds warm, and mak's th' land so as it
'll groo. So I thought happen it wur th' way God feathered aar nest
for us. Dun yo' see?  It's nobbud my fancy.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page208" id="page208" title="208"></a>
<p>&lsquo;And a beautiful fancy, too, Milly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And all that waning afternoon, as Mr. Penrose climbed the hills
amid the falling flakes, he thought of Milly's quaint conceit, and
looking round amid the gathering gloom, and seeing the great stretch
of snowy covering that now lay on the undulating sweeps, he asked
himself wherein lay the difference between the vision of John the
Divine when he saw the angels holding the four winds of heaven, and
Milly when she saw the angels giving of their warmth to earth in
falling flakes of snow.</p>

<p>As the darkness deepened, Mr. Penrose&mdash;fearless of the
storm, and at home on the wilds&mdash;made his way towards a lone
farmstead known as &lsquo;Granny Houses,&rsquo; and so-called
because of an old woman who lived there, and who, by keeping a light
in her window on dark winter nights, guided the colliers to a
distant pit across the moors. She was the quaint product of the
hills and of Calvinism, but shrewd withal, and of a kind heart.
Indeed, the young minister had taken a strong liking to her, and
frequently called at her far-away home.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ey, Mr. Penrose, whatever's brought yo aat
<a class="pagebreak" name="page209" id="page209" title="209"></a>
a neet like this?&rsquo; she cried, as the preacher stood white as a
ghost in the doorway of the farmstead. &lsquo;Come in and dry
yorsel. Yo're just i' time fur baggin (tea), and there's noan I'm as
fain to see as yo'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Mrs. Halstead; I'm glad to be here. It's a
grand night.&rsquo; And looking through the open doorway at the
great expanse of snow-covered moor, he said, &lsquo;What a beautiful
world God's world is&mdash;is it not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know noan so mich abaat its beauty, but I know its a
fearful cowd (cold) world to-neet. Shut that dur afore th' kitchen's
filled wi' snow. When yo're as owd as me yo'll noan be marlockin' i'
snow at this time o' neet. What's life to young uns is death to owd
uns, yo' know. But draw up to th' fire. That's reet; naa then, doff
that coite, and hev a soup o' tay. An' haa 'n yo' laft 'em all daan
at Rehoboth? Clammin', I reckon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You're not far from the word, Mrs. Halstead. Many of them
don't know where to-morrow's food and to-morrow's fire is coming
from.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, I dare say. Bud if they'd no more sense nor to spend
their brass in th' summer,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page210" id="page210" title="210"></a>
what can they expect? There's some fo'k think they can eyt their
cake and hev it. But th' Almeety doesn't bake bread o' that mak'. He
helps them as helps theirsels. He gay' five to th' chap as bed five,
and him as bed nobbud one, and did naught wi' it&mdash;why, He tuk
it fro' him, didn't He? I'll tell yo' what it is, Mr. Penrose,
there's a deal o' worldly wisdom i' providence.  Naa come, isn't
there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose laughed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Theer's that Oliver o' Deaf Martha's. Naa, I lay aught
he's noan so mich, wi' his dog-feightin' and poachin'. His missis
wur up here t'other day axin' for some milk for th' childer. An' hoo
said ut everybody wur ooined (punished for want of food) at their
house but Oliver an' th' dog. Theer's awlus enugh for
them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, I believe that is so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It wur that dog as welly killed Moses Fletcher, wurnd
it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think it was,&rsquo; replied Mr. Penrose.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And haa is owd Moses sin yo' dipped him o'er agen? It 'll
tak' some watter and grace to mak' him ought like, I reckon. But
they tell me he's takken to gien his brass away. It 'll
<a class="pagebreak" name="page211" id="page211" title="211"></a>
noan dry th' een o' th' poor fo'k he's made weep, tho'&mdash;will
it, Mr. Penrose?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not, Mrs. Halstead; but Moses is an altered
man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And noan afore it wur time. But what's that noise in th'
yard? It saands like th' colliers. What con they be doin' aat o' th'
pit at this time? They're noan off the shift afore ten, and it's
nobbud hawve-past six.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In another moment the door of the cottage was thrown open and a
collier entered, white with falling snow, and breathless. When he
had sufficiently recovered, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gronny, little Job Wallwork's getten crushed in th'
four-foot, and it's a'most up wi' him. They're bringin' on him
here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whatever wilto say next, lad? Poor little felley, where's
he getten hurt? On his yed?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay; he's crushed in his in'ards, and he hasnd spokken
sin'.  They're carryin' him on owd Malachi's coite.&rsquo;
(coat).</p>

<p>A sound of shuffling feet was heard in the snow, and four men,
holding the ends of a greatcoat, bore the pale-faced, swooning boy
into the glare of Mrs. Halstead's kitchen. His thin
<a class="pagebreak" name="page212" id="page212" title="212"></a>
features were drawn, and a clayey hue overspread his face&mdash;a
hue which, when she saw with her practised eye, she knew was the
shadow of the destroyer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor little felley!&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;and his
mother a widder an' all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And then, bending down over the settle whereon they had placed
the mangled lad, she pressed her lips on the pale brow, clammy with
the ooze of death&mdash;lips long since forsaken by the early blush
of beauty, yet still warm with the instinct which in all true women
feeds itself with the wasting years. Tears fell from her
eyes&mdash;tears that told of unfathomed deeps of motherhood,
despite her threescore years and ten; while with lean and tremulous
hand she combed back the dank masses of hair that lay in clusters
about the boy's pallid face. Her reverence and love thus
manifested&mdash;a woman's offering to tortured flesh in the dark
chamber of pain&mdash;she unbuckled the leathern strap that clasped
the little collier's breeches to his waist, and, with a touch gentle
enough to carry healing, bared the body, now discoloured and torn,
though still the veined and plastic marble&mdash;the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page213" id="page213" title="213"></a>
flesh-wall of the human temple, so fearfully and wonderfully
made.</p>

<p>The boy lay immobile. Scarce a pulse responded to the old woman's
touch as she placed the palm of her hand over the valve of his young
life. Nor did her fomentations rouse him, as feebler grew the
protest of the heart to the separation of the little soul from the
mangled body. At last the watchers thought the wrench was over, and
Death the lord of life.</p>

<p>Then the clayey hue, so long overshadowing the face, faded away
in the warmth of a returning tide of life, as a gray dawn is
suffused by sunrise. The beat became stronger and more frequent,
there was a movement in the passive limbs, and, opening his eyes
dreamily, then wonderingly, and at last consciously, the lad looked
into the old woman's face and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gronny!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi! it's Gronny, lad. And haa doesto feel?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy tried to move, and uttered a feeble cry of pain.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lie thee still, lad. Doesto think thaa can ston
this?&rsquo; and the old woman laid another hot flannel on the boy's
body.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page214" id="page214" title="214"></a>
<p>At first he winced, and a look of terrible torture passed over
his face. Then he smiled and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi! Gronny, aw can bide thee to do ought.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose, helpless and silent, stood at the foot of the settle
on which lay the dying boy, the colliers seeking the gloomy corners
of the large kitchen, where in shadow they awaited in rude fear the
death of their little companion. The old woman, cool and
self-possessed, plied her task with a tenderness and skill born of
long years of experience, cheering with words of endearment the last
moments of the sufferer.</p>

<p>The boy's rally was brief, for internal hæmorrhage set in, and
swiftly wrought its fatal work, sweeping the vital tide along
channels through which it no longer returned to the fount of life,
and leaving the weary face with a pallor that overmastered the flush
that awhile before brought a momentary hope. His eyes grew dim, and
the light from the lamp seemed to recede, as though it feared him,
and would elude his gaze. The figures in the room became mixed and
commingled, and took shapes which at times he failed to recognise.
Then a sensation
<a class="pagebreak" name="page215" id="page215" title="215"></a>
of falling seized him, and he planted his hands on the cushion of
the settle, as though he would stay his descent.</p>

<p>Looking at Mr. Penrose through a ray of consciousness, he
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Th' cage is goin' daan fearfo quick. Pray!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old woman caught the word, and, turning to the minister, she
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;He wants thee to mak' a prayer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose drew nearer to the boy, and repeated the grand
death-song of the saints: &lsquo;Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for Thou art
with me, Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy shook his head&mdash;for him the words had no meaning.
Then, raising himself, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ax God O'meety to leet His candle. I'm baan along th'
seam, an' it's fearfo dark!&rsquo;</p>

<p>To Mr. Penrose the words were strange, and, turning to the
colliers, he asked them what the boy wanted.</p>

<p>Then Malachi o' the Mount came towards the minister and said:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page216" id="page216" title="216"></a>

<p>&lsquo;Th' lad thinks he's i' th' four-foot seam, and he connot
find his road, it's so dark, and he wants a leet&mdash;a candle, yo'
know, same as we use in th' pit. He wants the Almeety to leet him
along.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Still Mr. Penrose was in darkness.</p>

<p>Then the boy turned to old Malachi, and, with a farewell look of
recognition and a last effort of speech, said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Malachi, ax Him as is aboon to leet His great candle, and
show me th' road along th' seam. It's some fearsome and
dark.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And Malachi knelt by the side of the lad, and, in broken accents
and rude vernacular, said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;O God O'meety, little Job's baan along th' four-foot seam,
an' he connot see his gate (way). Leet Thy candle, Lord&mdash;Thy
great candle&mdash;and mak' it as leet as day for th' lad. Leet it,
Lord, and dunnot put it aat till he geds through to wheere they've
no need o' candles, becose Thaa gies them th' leet o'
Thysel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prayer over, every eye was turned to the boy, on whose face
there had broken a great light&mdash;a light from above.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page217" id="page217" title="217"></a>
<a name="chapter5.2" id="chapter5.2"></a>
<h3>II.</h3><h3>THE TWO MOTHERS.</h3>

<p>The royal repose of death reigned over the features of little Job
as his mother entered the kitchen of the Granny Houses Farm. She had
been summoned from Rehoboth by a collier, fleet of foot, who, as
soon as the injured boy was brought to the pit-bank, started with
the sad news to the distant village. No sooner did the woman catch
the purport of the news, than she ran out wildly into the snowy
air&mdash;not waiting to don shawl or clogs, but speeding over the
white ground as those only speed who love, and who know their loved
ones are in need.</p>

<p>A wild wind was blowing from the north, and the fleecy particles
fell in fantastic whirls and spirals, to drift in treacherous banks
over the gullies and falls that lay along the path;
<a class="pagebreak" name="page218" id="page218" title="218"></a>
while here and there thin black lines, sinuous in their trend, told
where moorland waters flowed, and guided the hurrying mother to her
distant goal. The groaning trees, tossed by the tempest, flung off
showers of half-frozen flakes, that falling on her flaming cheeks
failed to cool the fever of her suspense, while the yielding snow
beneath her feet became a tantalus path, delaying her advance, and
seeming to make more distant her suffering child.</p>

<p>Ploughing her way through the Green Fold Clough, she climbed the
steeps at the further end, and stood, breathless, on the bank of the
great reservoir that lay dark in the hollow of the white hills. Her
heart beat savagely and loud&mdash;so loud that she heard it above
the din of the storm; and cruel pain relentlessly stabbed her
heaving side, while her breath was fetched in quick
respirations.</p>

<p>As she thus stood, tamed in her race of love by the imperative
call of exhausted nature, Dr. Hale loomed through the snowy haze,
and, reading instinctively who she was and whither she was bound,
proffered his assistance for the remaining half of the journey.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page219" id="page219" title="219"></a>
<p>He had not walked with her for many yards before he saw her
exposed condition. Her hair was flying in frozen tresses about her
unshawled bosom, and no outer covering protected her from the chill
blast.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Wallwork,&lsquo; said he, &lsquo;you ought not to be
crossing the moors a night like this, uncovered as you are. You are
tempting Nature to do her worst with you, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ne'er heed me, doctor. It's mi lad yon aw want yo' to
heed. I shall be all reet if he's nobbud reet. I con walk faster if
yo' con,&rsquo; and so saying, the jaded woman sprang, like a stung
horse, under the spur of love.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I have two lives to think of,&rsquo; replied Dr. Hale,
&lsquo;both mother's and son's.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mine's naught, doctor, when he's i' danger. Who bothers
their yeds abaat theirsels when them as they care more for are i'
need?  Let's hurry up, doctor.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And again she sprang forward, to struggle with renewed effort
through the yielding snow. Then, turning towards her companion, she
cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where wur he hurt, doctor? Did they tell yo'?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page220" id="page220" title="220"></a>
<p>But the doctor was silent.</p>

<p>Seizing his arm with eager grip, she continued:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dun yo' think he's livin', doctor? Or is he deead? Did
they say he wur deead?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We must be patient a little longer,&rsquo; was the
doctor's kind reply.  &lsquo;See! there's the light in the window of
Granny Houses!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And there shone the light&mdash;distant across the fields, and
blurred and indistinct through the falling snow. Without waiting to
find the path, the mother ran in a direct line towards it, scaling
the walls with the nimbleness of youth, to fall exhausted on the
threshold of the farmstead.</p>

<p>Raising herself, she looked round with a blank stare, dazed with
the glow of the fire and the light of the lamp. In the further
corners of the room, and away from each other, sat the old woman and
Mr. Penrose and Malachi o' the Mount, while on the settle beneath
the window lay the sheeted dead.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where's th' lad?&rsquo; cried the mother, the torture of a
great fear racking her features and agonizing her voice.</p>

<p>There was no reply, the three watchers by
<a class="pagebreak" name="page221" id="page221" title="221"></a>
the dead helplessly and mutely gazing at the snow-covered figure
that stood beneath the open doorway within a yard of her child.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gronny, doesto yer? Where's my lad? And yo',
Malachi&mdash;yo' took him daan th' shaft wi' yo'; what ban yo' done
wi' him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Still there was no response. A paralysis silenced each lip. None
of the three possessed a heart that dared disclose the secret.</p>

<p>Seeing the sheeted covering on the settle, the woman, with
frantic gesture, tore it aside, and when her eye fell on the little
face, grand in death's calm, a great rigor took hold of her, and
then she became rigid as the dead on whom her gaze was fixed.</p>

<p>In a little while she stooped over the boy, and, baring the cold
body, looked long at the crushed and discoloured parts, at last
bending low her face and kissing them until they were warm with her
caress. Then old granny, turning round to Mr. Penrose,
whispered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank God, hoo's weepin'!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let her weep,&rsquo; said Dr. Hale; &lsquo;there's no
medicine like tears.&rsquo;</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<a class="pagebreak" name="page222" id="page222" title="222"></a>
<p>That night, long after the snow had ceased to fall, and the
tempestuous winds with folded wings were hushed in repose, and
distant stars glittered in steely brightness, the two women, holding
each other's hand, sat over the hearth of the solitary moorland
farmstead. They were widows both, and both now were sisters in the
loss of an only child.</p>

<p>Granny, as she was called, bore that name not from relationship,
but from her kindliness and age. It was the pet name given to her by
the colliers to whom she so often ministered in their risks and
exposures at the adjacent pit. Into her life the rain had fallen.
After fifteen years of domestic joy, her only child, a son, fell
before the breath of fever, and in the shadow of that loss she ever
since walked. Then her husband succumbed to the exposure of a
winter's toil, and now for long she had lived alone. But as she used
to say, &lsquo;Suppin' sorrow had made her to sup others' sorrow
with them.&rsquo; Her cup, though deep and full, had not embittered
her heart, but led her to drink with those whose cup was deeper than
her own. The death of little Job had rolled away the stone from the
mouth of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page223" id="page223" title="223"></a>
the sepulchre of her own dead child; and as she held the hand of the
lately-bereaved mother she dropped many a word of comfort.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'll tell thee what aw've bin thinkin',&rsquo; said the
old woman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What han yo' bin thinkin', Gronny?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, I've bin thinkin' haa good th' Almeety is&mdash;He's
med angels o' them as we med lads.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I durnd know what yo' mean, Gronny.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, it's i' this way, lass; my Jimmy and yor little Job
wur aar own, wurnd they?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, forsure they wur.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We feshioned 'em, as the Psalmist sez, didn't
we?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa sez truth, Gronny,&rsquo; wept the younger woman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And we feshioned 'em lads an' o'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, and fine uns; leastways, my little Job wur&mdash;bless
him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the mother turned her tearful eyes towards the settle whereon
lay the corpse.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, cornd yo' see as God hes finished aar wark for us,
and what we made lads, He's made angels on?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But aw'd sooner ha' kept mine. Angels are
<a class="pagebreak" name="page224" id="page224" title="224"></a>
up aboon, thaa knows; an' heaven's a long way off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Happen noan so far as thaa thinks, lass; and then th'
Almeety will do better by 'em nor we con.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, noan so, Gronny. God cornd love Job better nor I
loved him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But he willn't ged crushed in a coile seam i' heaven; naa,
lass, will he?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa's reet, Gronny, he willn't. But if He mak's us work
here, why does He kill us o'er th' job, as he's killed mi little
lad?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa mun ax Mr. Penrose that, lass; I'm no
scholard.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw'll tell thee what it is, Gronny. It noan seems reet
that thee and me should be sittin' by th' fire, and little Job
yonder cowd i' th' shadow. Let's pool up th' settle to th' fire;
he's one on us, though he's deead.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let him alone, lass; he's better off nor them as wants
fire; there's no cowd wheer he's goan.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Rising from her chair, and turning the sheet once more from off
the boy's face, the mother said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where hasto goan, lad? Tell thi mother,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page225" id="page225" title="225"></a>
willn't taa?&rsquo; And then, looking round at the old woman, she
said, &lsquo;Doesto think he yers (hears) me, Gronny?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw welly think he does, lass; but durnd bother him naa.
He's happen restin', poor little lad; or happen he's telling them as
is up aboon all abaat thee&mdash;who knows?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw say, Gronny, Jesus made deead fo'k yer Him when He
spok', didn't He?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lass, He did forsure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who wur that lass He spok' to when He turned 'em all aat
o' th' room, wi' their noise and shaatin'?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tha means th' rich mon's lass, doesndto?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi! Did He ever do ought for a poor mon's lass?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He did for a poor woman's lad, thaa knows&mdash;a widder's
son&mdash;one like thine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But he's noan here naa, so we's be like to bide by it, ey,
dear?  Mi lad! mi lad!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don't tak' on like that, lass; noather on us 'll hev to
bide long. It's a long road, I know, when fo'k luk for'ards; but
it's soon getten o'er, and when thaa looks back'ards it's nobbud
short.  I tell thee I've tramped it, and I durnd know as
<a class="pagebreak" name="page226" id="page226" title="226"></a>
I'm a war woman for the journey. It's hard wark partin' wi' your
own; but then theer's th' comfort o' havin' had 'em. I'd rayther hev
a child and bury it, nor be baat childer, like Miriam Heap
yonder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw dare say as yo're reet, Gronny; aw's cry and fret a
deal over little Job, but then aw's hev summat to think abaat,
shornd I? Aw geet his likeness taken last Rehoboth fair by a chap as
come in a callivan (caravan), and it hengs o'er th' chimley-piece.
But aw's noan see th' leet in his een ony more, nor yer his voice,
nor tak' him wi' me to th' chapel on Sundos,&rsquo; and the woman
again turned to the dead boy, and fondly lingered over his familiar
features, weeping over them her tears of despair.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come, lass, tha munn't tak' on like that. Sit yo' daan,
an' I'll tell yo' what owd Mr. Morell said to me when mi lad lay
deead o' th' fayver, and noan on 'em would come near me. He said I
mut (must) remember as th' Almeety had nobbud takken th' lad
upstairs.  But aw sez, &ldquo;Mr. Morell, theer's mony steps, an' I
cornd climb 'em.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yi,&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;theer is
mony steps, but yo' keep climbin' on 'em every day, and one day
yo'll ged to th' top and be i' th'
<a class="pagebreak" name="page227" id="page227" title="227"></a>
same raam (room) wi' him.&rdquo; An', doesto know, every time as I
fretted and felt daan, I used to think o' him as was upstairs, and
remember haa aw wur climbin' th' steps an' gettin' nearer
him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But yo've noan getten to th' top yet, Gronny.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, aw hevn't, but aw'm a deal nearer nor aw wur when he
first laft me. An' doesto know, lass, aw feel misel to be gettin' so
near naa that aw can welly yer him singin'. There's nobbud a step or
two naa, and then we's be i' th' same raam.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' is th' Almeety baan to mak' me climb as mony steps as
thaa's climbed afore I ged into th' same raam as He's takken little
Job too, thinksto?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ey, lass. Aw durnd know; but whether thaa's to climb mony
or few thaa'll hev strength gien thee, as aw hev.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw wish God's other room wurnd so far off,
Gronny&mdash;nobbud t'other side o' th' wall instead o' th' story
aboon. Durnd yo'?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, lass; they're safer upstairs. Thaa knows He put's 'em
aat o' harm's way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But aw somehaa think aw could ha' takken
<a class="pagebreak" name="page228" id="page228" title="228"></a>
care o' little Job a bit longer. And when he'd groon up, thaa knows,
he could ha' takken care o' me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lass; we're awlus for patchin' th'Almeety's work; and
if He leet us, we's mak' a sorry mess on it and o'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, Gronny, if I wur God Almeety I'd be agen lettin'
lumps o' coile fall and crush th' life aat o' lads like aar Job.
It's a queer way o' takkin 'em upstairs, as yo' co it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hooisht! lass, thaa mornd try to speerit through th'
clouds that are raand abaat His throne. He tak's one i' one way, an
another i' another; but if He tak's em to Hissel they're better off
than they'd be wi' us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, Gronny, aw tell thee, aw cornd see it i' that way
yet;&rsquo; and again the mother caressed the body of her son.</p>

<p>Once more she turned towards the old woman, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw shouldn't ha' caared so mich, Gronny, if he'd deed as
yor lad deed&mdash;i' his own bed, an' wi' a fayver; bud he wur
crushed wi' a lump o' coile! Poor little lad! Luk yo' here!&rsquo;
and the mother bared the body and showed the discoloured parts.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page229" id="page229" title="229"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Did ta' ever see a child dee o' fayver, lass?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not as aw know on. Aw've awlus bin flayed, and never gone
near 'em.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa may thank God as thy lad didn't dee of a fayver. Aw's
never forgeet haa th' measter and I watched and listened to aar
lad's ravin's. Haa he rached aat wi' his honds, and kept settin' up
and makin' jumps at what he fancied he see'd abaat him; and when we
co'd him he never knowed us. Nowe, lass, he never knowed me until
one neet he seemed to come to hissel, and then he looked at me and
said, &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; But it wur all he said&mdash;he never
spok' at after.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi; but yo' see'd yur lad dee&mdash;and mine deed afore I
could get to him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is so, lass! but as aw stood an' see'd mine deein', I
would ha' gien onything if I could ha' shut mi een, or not bin wi'
him.  I know summat as what Hagar felt when hoo said, &ldquo;Let me
not see th' deeath o' th' child&rdquo;&mdash;I do so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The younger woman wept, and the tears brought relief to her
pent-up heart. She had found a mother's ear for her mother's sorrow;
and the after-calm of a great grief was now falling over her. She
leaned her aching head on
<a class="pagebreak" name="page230" id="page230" title="230"></a>
the shoulders of the older and stronger woman by whose side she sat,
and at last her sorrow brought the surcease of sleep. The fire threw
its fitful flicker on her haggard face, lighting up in strange
relief the lines of agony and the moisture of the freshly fallen
tears. Now and again she sobbed in her slumber&mdash;a sob that
shook her soul&mdash;but she slept, and sleep brought peace and
oblivion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sleep on, lass, sleep on, and God ease thi poor
heart,&rsquo; said the old Granny, as she held the woman's hand in
hers. &lsquo;Thaa's hed both thi travails naa; thaa's travailed i'
birth, and thaa's travailed i' deeath, like mony a poor soul afore
thee. There wur joy when thaa brought him into th' world, and
theer's sorrow naa he's goan aat afore his time. Ey, dear! A
mother's life's like an April morn&mdash;sunleet and cloud, fleshes
o' breetness, and showers o' rain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And closing her eyes, she, too, slept. And in that lone outlying
fold, far away in the snowy bosom of the hills, there was the sleep
of weariness, the sleep of sorrow, and the sleep of death.  And who
shall say that the last was not the kindliest and most welcome?</p>

<h3>III.</h3><h3>THE SNOW CRADLE.</h3>

<p>As Mr. Penrose and Malachi o' th' Mount closed the door of Granny
Houses on the sorrowing widowed mother, there opened to them a fairy
realm of snow. Stepping out on its yielding carpet of crystals, they
looked in silent wonder at the fair new world, where wide moors
slept in peaceful purity, and distant hills lifted their white
summits towards the deep cold blue of the clearing sky. Steely stars
glittered and magnified their light through the lens of the eager,
frosty air, and old landmarks were hidden, and roads familiar to the
wayfarer no longer discovered their trend. Little hillocks had taken
the form of mounds, and stretches of level waste were swept by
ranges of drift and shoulders of obstructing snow.</p>

<p>No sooner did Mr. Penrose look out on this
<a class="pagebreak" name="page232" id="page232" title="232"></a>
new earth than a feeling of <i>lostness</i> came on him, and,
linking his arm in that of the old man, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can you find the way, Malachi?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wheer to, Mr. Penrose?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, to Rehoboth, of course. Where else did you think I
wanted to go at this time of night?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, that's what I wur wonderin' when yo' axed me if I
knew th' way,&rsquo; replied the old man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! I beg your pardon; I thought perhaps the snow might
throw you off the track.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Throw <i>me</i> off th' track, an' on these moors and o'?
Nowe, Mr.  Penrose, I hevn't lived on 'em forty years for naught, I
con tell yo'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But when you cannot see your way, what then?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then I walks by instink.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And by instinct the two men crossed the wastes of snow towards
the Green Fold Clough, through which gorge lay the path that led to
the village below.</p>

<p>Just as they traversed the edge of the Red Moss, old Malachi
broke the silence by saying:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page233" id="page233" title="233"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mr. Penrose, what do yo' think o' yon?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Think of what, Malachi?&rsquo; asked the perplexed divine,
for neither of them, for some moments, had spoken.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Think o' yon lad as has getten killed, and o' his
mother?&rsquo;</p>

<p>There are times when a man dares not utter his deepest feelings
because of the commonplace character of the words through which they
only can find expression. If Malachi had asked Mr. Penrose to write
the character of God on a blackboard before a class of infants, he
would not have been placed in a greater difficulty than that now
involved by the question of Malachi. Already his mind was dark with
the problem of suffering. Little Job's cry for &lsquo;the candle of
the Almeety&rsquo; had reached depths he knew not were hidden in his
heart; while the look in the mother's face, as she stood
snow-covered in the doorway of the farmstead, and as the firelight
lent its glare to her blanched and pain-wrought face, continued
ceaselessly to haunt him. And now Malachi wanted to know what he
thought of it all! How could he tell him?</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page234" id="page234" title="234"></a>
<p>Finding Mr. Penrose remained silent, Malachi continued:
&lsquo;Yon woman's supped sorrow, and no mistak'. Hoo buried her
husband six months afore yon lad wur born. Poor little felley! he
never know'd his faither.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! I never knew that. Then she <i>has</i> supped sorrow,
as you call it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Owd Mr. Morell used to say as he could awlus see her deead
husband's face i' hers until th' child wur born, and then it left
her, and hoo carried th' face o' th' little un hoo brought up. But
it'll be a deead face hoo'll carry in her een naa, I'll be bun
for't.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How was it his mother sent him to work in the
pit?&mdash;such a dangerous calling, and the boy so
young.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You'll know a bit more, Mr. Penrose, when yo've lived here
a bit longer. His fo'k and hers hev bin colliers further back nor I
can remember; and they noan change trades wi' us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But why need he go to work so young?&rsquo; asked the
minister.</p>

<p>Malachi stopped and gazed in astonishment at the minister, and
then said:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page235" id="page235" title="235"></a>
<p>&lsquo;I durnd know as he would ha' worked in th' pit, Mr.
Penrose, if you'd ha' kep' him and his mother and o'. But fo'k mun
eat, thaa knows. Th' Almeety's gan o'er rainin' daan manna fro'
heaven, as He used to do in th' wilderness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose did not reply.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yo' know, Mr. Penrose,&rsquo; continued Malachi,
&lsquo;workin' in a coile-pit is like preychin': it's yezzy (easy)
enugh when yo' ged used to 't. An' as for danger&mdash;why, yo'
connot ged away fro' it.  As owd Amos sez, yo're as safe i' one
hoile (workshop) as another.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; that's sound philosophy,&rsquo; assented Mr.
Penrose.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mr. Morell once tell'd us in his preychin' abaat a chap as
axed a oracle, or summat, what kind of a deeath he would dee; and
when he wur towd that he would happen an accident o' some sort, they
couldn't geet him to shift aat o' his garden, for fear he'd be
killed. But it wur all no use; for one day, as he wur sittin' amang
his flaars, a great bird dropped a stooan, and smashed his yed. So
yo' see, Mr. Penrose, if yo've to dee in th' pulpit yo'll dee theer,
just as little Job deed i' th' coile-pit.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page236" id="page236" title="236"></a>
<p>As Malachi delivered himself of this bit of Calvinistic
philosophy, a sound of voices was borne in on the two men from the
vale below, and looking in the direction whence it came, the old man
and Mr. Penrose saw a group of dark figures thrown into relief on
the background of snow.</p>

<p>The sounds were too distant to be distinctly heard, but every now
and then there was mingled with them the short, sharp bark of a
dog.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I welly think that's Oliver o' Deaf Martha's dog,&rsquo;
excitedly cried Malachi. &lsquo;Surely he's noan poachin' a neet
like this? He's terrible lat' wi' his wark if he is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I'm not mistaken, that is Moses Fletcher's
voice,&rsquo; replied Mr.  Penrose. &lsquo;Listen!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You're reet; that's Moses' voice, or I'm a Jew. What's he
doin' aat a neet like this, wi' Oliver's dog? I thought he'd bed
enough o' that beast to last his lifetime.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The two men were now leaning over a stone wall and looking down
into the ravine below. Suddenly Malachi pricked up his ears, and
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' that's Amos's voice an' all. By Guy, if
<a class="pagebreak" name="page237" id="page237" title="237"></a>
it hedn't bin for Oliver o' Deaf Martha's I should ha' said it wur
hevin' a prayer-meetin' i' th' snow. What's brought owd Amos aat wi'
Moses&mdash;to say naught o' th' dog?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Just then an oath reached the ears of the listening men.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No prayer-meeting, Malachi,&rsquo; said Mr. Penrose,
laughing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe&mdash;nobbud unless they're like Ab' o' th' Heights,
who awlus swore a bit i' his prayers, because, as he said, swearin'
wur mighty powerful. But him as swore just naa is Oliver
hissel&mdash;I'll lay mi Sunday hat on't.&rsquo;</p>

<p>By this time the moving figures on the snow were approaching the
foot of the hill whereon the two men stood, and Malachi, raising his
hands to his mouth, greeted them with a loud halloo.</p>

<p>Immediately there came a reply. It was from Oliver himself, in a
loud, importuning voice:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Han yo' fun him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fun who?&rsquo; asked Malachi.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, that chilt o' mine! Who didsto think we wur lookin'
for?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page238" id="page238" title="238"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Who knew yo' were lookin' for aught but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Which child have you lost?&rsquo; cried Mr. Penrose, for
Oliver had a numerous family.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Little Billy&mdash;him as Moses pooled aat o' the
lodge.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come along, Malachi, let us go down and help; it's a
search party.&rsquo;</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>Everybody in Rehoboth knew little Billy o' Oliver's o' Deaf
Martha's. He was a smart lad of eight years, with a vivid
imagination and an active brain. His childish idealism, however,
found little food in the squalid cottage in which he dragged out his
semi-civilized existence; but among the hills he was at home, and
there he roamed, to find in their fastnesses a region of romance,
and in their gullies and cloughs the grottoes and falls that to him
were a veritable fairy realm. Child as he was, in the summer months
he roamed the shady plantations, and sailed his chip and paper boats
down their brawling streams, feeding on the nuts and berries, and
lying for hours asleep beneath the shadows of their branching trees.
He was one of the few
<a class="pagebreak" name="page239" id="page239" title="239"></a>
children into whose mind Amos failed to find an inlet for the
catechism; and once, during the past summer, he had blown his
wickin-whistle in Sunday-school class, and been reprimanded by the
superintendent because he gathered blackberries during the sacred
hours.</p>

<p>A few days previous to his disappearance in the snow he had heard
the legend of Jenny Greenteeth, the haunting fairy of the Green Fold
Clough, and how that she, who in the summer-time made the flowers
grow and the birds sing, hid herself in winter on a shelf of rock
above the Gin Spa Well, a lone streamlet that gurgled from out the
rocky sides of the gorge. The story laid hold of his young mind, and
under the glow of his imagination assumed the proportions of an
Arabian Nights' wonder. He dreamed of it by night, and during the
day received thrashings not a few from his zealous schoolmaster,
because his thoughts were away from his lessons with Jenny
Greenteeth in her Green Fold Clough retreat. On this, the afternoon
of the first snowfall of the autumn, there being a half-holiday, the
boy determined once more to explore the haunts of the fairy; and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page240" id="page240" title="240"></a>
just as Mr. Penrose turned out of his lodgings to kill the prose of
his life, which he felt to be killing him, Oliver o' Deaf Martha's
little boy turned out of his father's hovel to feed the poetry that
was stirring in his youthful soul. The north wind blew through the
rents and seams of his threadbare clothing; but its chill was not
felt, so warm with excitement beat his little heart. And when the
first flakes fell, he clapped his hands in wild delight, and sang of
the plucking of geese by hardy Scotchmen, and the sending of their
feathers across the intervening leagues.</p>

<p>Poor little fellow! His was a hard lot when looked at from where
Plenty spread her table and friends were manifold. But he was not
without his compensations. His home was the moors, and his parent
was Nature. He knew how to leap a brook, and snare a bird, and climb
a tree, and shape a boat, and cut a wickin-whistle, and many a time
and oft, when bread was scarce, he fed on the berries that only
asked to be plucked, and grew so plentifully along the sides of the
great hills.</p>

<p>The dusk was falling, and the snow beginning
<a class="pagebreak" name="page241" id="page241" title="241"></a>
to lie thick, as he entered the dark gorge of the Clough; but to him
darkness and light were alike, and as for the snow, it was more than
a transformation-scene is to the petted child of a jaded
civilization.  He watched the flakes as they came down in their wild
race from the sky, and saw them disappear on touching the stream
that ran through the heart of the Clough. He gathered masses of the
flaky substance in his hand, and, squeezing them into balls, threw
them at distant objects, and then filled his mouth with the icy
particles, and revelled in the shock and chill of the melting
substance between his teeth as no connoisseur of wine ever revelled
in the juices of the choice vintages of Spain and France.  Then he
would shake and clap his hands because of what he called the
&lsquo;hot ache&rsquo; that seized them, only to scamper off again
after some new object around which to weave another dream of
wonder.</p>

<p>The dusk gave place to gloom, and still faster fell the snow,
white and feathery, silent and sublime. The child felt the charm,
and began to lose himself in the impalpable something that, like a
curtain of spirit, gathered
<a class="pagebreak" name="page242" id="page242" title="242"></a>
around. He, too, was now as white as the shrubs through which he
wended his way, and every now and then he doffed his cap, and, with
a wild laugh of delight, flung its covering of snow upon the ground.
Then, out of sheer fulness of life and rapport with the scene, he
would rush for a yard or two up the steep sides of the Clough and
roll downwards in the soft substance which lay deeply around.</p>

<p>The gloom thickened and nightfall came, but the snow lighted up
the dark gorge, and threw out the branching trees, the tall trunks
of which rose columnar-like as the pillars of some cathedral nave.
Did the boy think of home&mdash;of fire&mdash;of bed? Not he! He
thought only of Jenny Greenteeth, the sprite of the Clough, and of
the Gin Spa Well, above which she was said to sleep; and on he
roamed.</p>

<p>And now the path became narrower and more tortuous, while on the
steep sides the snow was gathering in ominous drifts. Undaunted he
struggled on, knee-deep, often stumbling, yet always rising to dive
afresh into the yielding element that lay between himself and the
enchanted ground beyond. In a little time he
<a class="pagebreak" name="page243" id="page243" title="243"></a>
came to a great bulging bend, around the foot of which the waters
flowed in sullen sweeps. Here, careful as he was, he slipped, and
lay for a moment stunned and chilled with his sudden immersion.
Struggling to the bank, he regained his foothold, and, rounding the
promontory of cliff which had almost defeated his search, he turned
the angle that hid the grotto, and found himself at the Gin Spa
Well.</p>

<p>He heard the &lsquo;drip, drip&rsquo; of falling waters as they
oozed from out their rocky bed, and fell into one of those tiny
hollows of nature which, overflowing, sent its burden towards the
stream below. He looked above, and saw the fabled ledge&mdash;its
mossy bank all snow-covered&mdash;with the entrance to Jenny
Greenteeth's chambers dark against the white that lay around. Tired
with the search, yet glad at heart with the find, he climbed and
entered, the somnolence wrought by the snow soon closing his eyes,
and its subtle opiate working on his now wearily excited brain.
There he slept&mdash;and dreamed.</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>As soon as Mr. Penrose and Malachi reached the search party, and
heard how the boy had
<a class="pagebreak" name="page244" id="page244" title="244"></a>
been missing since the afternoon, the minister suggested they should
search the Clough, as it was his favourite haunt. His advice was at
first unheeded, Oliver declaring he had been taken off in a gipsy
caravan, and Amos capping his suspicion by speaking of the judgments
of the Almighty on little lads who gathered flowers on Sunday, and
blew wickin-whistles in school, and refused to learn their
catechism.  Second thoughts, however, brought them over to Mr.
Penrose's mind, and they set out for the Clough.</p>

<p>The descent was far from easy, the banks being steep, and
treacherous with their covering of newly-fallen snow. Once or twice
Amos, in his declaration of the Divine will, nearly lost his
footing, and narrowly escaped falling into the defile, the entrance
to which they sought to gain. Oliver manifested his anxiety and
parental care in sundry oaths, while Moses Fletcher, who had loved
the child ever since saving him from the Lodge, said little and
retained his wits.</p>

<p>When the search party entered the heart of the Clough, Oliver's
dog began to show signs of excitement, that became more and more
noticeable as they drew near to the Gin Spa Well.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page245" id="page245" title="245"></a>
Here the brute suddenly stopped and whined, and commenced to wildly
caper.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Th' dog's goin' mad,&rsquo; said Amos.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's noan as mad as thee, owd lad,&rsquo; replied Moses.
&lsquo;I'll lay ought we'n noan so far fro' th' chilt.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is always wise to stop when a dog stops,&rsquo;
assented the minister.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi; yo' connot stand agen instink,&rsquo; said
Malachi.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good lad! good lad! find him!&rsquo; sobbed Oliver to his
dog; and the brute again whined and wagged its tail and ran round
and between the legs of the men.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There's naught here,&rsquo; impatiently cried Amos.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'll tak' a dog's word agen thine ony day, owd lad,&rsquo;
said Moses.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, thaa's no need to be so fond o' th' dog. It once
welly worried thi dog, and thee into th' bargain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi; it's bin a bruiser i' id time, an' no mistak'; but
it's turned o'er a new leaf naa&mdash;and it's noan so far off th'
child;&rsquo; and Malachi, too, commenced to encourage it in its
search.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page246" id="page246" title="246"></a>
<p>&lsquo;It looks to me as th' child's getten up theer
somehaa;&rsquo; and so saying, Moses pointed to the ledge of rock
where Jenny Greenteeth was said to slumber through the winter's
cold.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What mut th' child ged up theer for?&rsquo; asked Amos.
&lsquo;Thaa talks like a chap as never hed no childer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this rebuff Moses was silent; for not only was he a childless
man, but until the day he saved the very child they were now seeking
from the Green Fold Lodge, children had been nothing to him. Now,
however, he had learned to love them, and none better than the
little lost offspring of Oliver o' Deaf Martha's.</p>

<p>While the two men were wrangling, Mr. Penrose stepped aside and
commenced the climb towards the ledge. The snow lay white and
undisturbed on the shelving surface, and there was no sign of recent
movements. Looking round, he discovered the mouth of the recess.
There it stood, black and forbidding. In another moment the minister
stooped down and looked in; but all was dark and silent, nor did he
care to go further along what to him was an unknown way.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have any of you a light?&rsquo; asked he of the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page247" id="page247" title="247"></a>
men below; and Malachi handed him his collier's candle and matches,
with which he commenced to penetrate the gloom.</p>

<p>It was a small cavernous opening out of which, in years past, men
had quarried stone. Damp dripped from the roof, and ran down its
seamed and discoloured sides. Autumn leaves, swept there by the
wind, strewed its uneven floor, and lay in heaps against the jutting
angles. A thin line of snow had drifted in through the mouth, and
ran like a river of light along the gloomy entrance, to lose itself
in the recesses beyond.</p>

<p>The feeble flicker of the candle which Mr. Penrose held in his
hand flung hideous shadows, and lighted up the cave dimly enough to
make it more eerie and grotesque. The minister had not searched long
before he was startled by a cry&mdash;a faint and childish cry:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Arto Jenny Greenteeth?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, my boy; I'm Mr. Penrose.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's noan th' parson aw want; aw want th'
fairy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And then the chilled and startled boy was carried down to the men
below.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page248" id="page248" title="248"></a>
<p>In a moment Oliver o' Deaf Martha's seized his boy and wrapped
him in the bosom of his coat, hugging and kissing him as though he
would impart the warmth of his own life to the little fellow.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's noan like thee to mak' a do like that, Oliver,&rsquo;
said Amos, unmoved, &lsquo;but thaa shaps (shapes) weel.&rsquo; And
as the child began to cry and struggle, Amos continued,
&lsquo;Sithee! he's feeard on thee.  He's noan used to it. He thinks
he ought to hev a lickin' or summat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Oliver continued his caresses.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, Oliver, I've never sin thee takken th' road
afore.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, lad! I've never lost a chilt afore.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>I.</h3><h3>A WOMAN'S SECRET.</h3>

<p>On a little mound, within the shadow of her cottage home, and
eagerly scanning the moors, stood Miriam Heap. An exultant light
gleamed in her dark eyes, and her bosom rose and fell as though
swept with tumultuous passion. Ever womanly and beautiful, she was
never more a queen than now, as the wind tossed the raven tresses of
her crown of hair, and wrapped her dress around the
well-proportioned limbs until she looked the draped statue of a
classic age. There was that, too, within her breast which filled her
with lofty and pardonable pride, for she awaited her husband's
return to communicate to him the royal secret of a woman's life.</p>

<p>Miriam and Matthias&mdash;or Matt, as she called him&mdash;had
been seven years married, the only shadow of their home being its
childlessness.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page252" id="page252" title="252"></a>
Matt's prayers and Miriam's tears brought no surcease to this
sorrow, while the cruel superstition that dearth of offspring was
the curse of heaven and the shame of woman, rested as a perpetual
gloom over the otherwise happy home.</p>

<p>Of late, however, the maternal hope had arisen in the heart of
Miriam; nor was the hope belied. To her, as to Mary of old, the
mystic messengers had whispered, and He with whom are the issues of
life had regarded the low estate of His handmaiden. That of which
she so long fondly dreamed, and of late scarce dared to think of,
was now a fact, and a great and unspeakable joy filled her
heart.</p>

<p>As yet her secret was unshared. Even her husband knew it not, for
Matt was away in a distant town, fitting up machinery in a
newly-erected mill. Miriam felt it to be as hard to carry alone the
burden of a great joy as the burden of a great sorrow. But she
resolved that none should know before him, whose right it was to
first share the secret with herself; so she kept it, and pondered
over it in her heart.</p>

<p>And now Matt was on his homeward journey,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page253" id="page253" title="253"></a>
and Miriam knew that shortly they would be together in their cottage
home. How should she meet him, and greet him, and confess to him the
joy that overwhelmed her? What would he say? Would he love her more,
or would the advent of the little life divide the love hitherto her
undisputed own? Was the love of father towards mother a greater and
stronger and holier love than that of husband towards wife? or did
the birth of children draw off from each what was before a mutual
interchange? Thus she teased her throbbing brain, and vexed her mind
with questions she knew not how to solve. And yet her woman's
instincts told her that the new love would weld together more
closely the old, and that she and Matt would become one as never
before. And then a dim memory of a sentence in the old creed came
upon her&mdash;something about &lsquo;One in three and three in one,
undivided and eternal&rsquo;&mdash;but she knew not what she
thought.</p>

<p>As Miriam stood upon the little mound within the shadow of her
roof-tree, eagerly scanning the moors for Matt's return, cool airs
laden with moorland scents played around her, and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page254" id="page254" title="254"></a>
masses of snowy cloud sailed along the horizon, flushing beneath the
touch of the after-glow with as pure a rose as that mantling on her
womanly face. The blue distances overhead were deepening with
sundown, and the great sweeps of field and wild were sombre with the
hill shadows that began to fall. In a copse near where she stood a
little bird was busy with her fledglings, and from a meadow came the
plaintive bleat of a late yeaned lamb. From the distant village the
wind carried to her ears the cry of an infant&mdash;a cry that
lingered and echoed and started strange melodies in the awakening
soul of Miriam. Child of the hills as she was, never before in all
her thirty years of familiarity with them, and freedom among them,
had she seen and felt them as now. A great and holy passion was upon
her, and she took all in through the medium of its golden haze. The
early flowers at her feet glowed like stars of hope and
promise&mdash;and the bursting buds of the trees told of spring's
teeming womb and dew of youth; while the shadow of her cottage gable
and chimney&mdash;falling as it did across the little mound on which
she stood&mdash;recalled to her the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page255" id="page255" title="255"></a>
promises of Him who setteth the solitary in families.</p>

<p>Then she returned to herself, and to her new and opening world of
maternity. No longer would she be the butt at which the rude, though
good-natured, jests of her neighbours were thrown, for she too would
soon hold up her head proudly among the mothers of Rehoboth. And as
for Matt's mother&mdash;fierce Calvinist that she was, and whom in
the past she had so much feared&mdash;what cared she for her now?
She would cease to be counted by her as one of the uncovenanted, and
told that she had broken the line of promise given to the elect. How
well she remembered the night when the old woman, taking up the
Bible, read out aloud: &lsquo;The promise is unto you, and to your
children,&rsquo; afterwards clinching the words by saying:
&lsquo;Thaa sees, Miriam, thaas noan in it, for thaa's no
childer&rsquo;; and how, when she gently protested, &lsquo;But is
not the promise to all that are afar off?&rsquo; the elect sister of
the church and daughter of God destroyed her one ray of hope by
saying: &lsquo;Yi!  but only to as mony as the Lord aar God shall
co.&rsquo; And Matt&mdash;poor Matt&mdash;across
<a class="pagebreak" name="page256" id="page256" title="256"></a>
whom the cold shadow had so long lain, and which, despite his love
of her, would creep now and again like a cloud over the sunshine of
his face&mdash;Matt, too, would be redeemed from his long
disappointment, and renewed in strength as he saw a purpose in his
life's struggle, even the welfare of his posterity.  These thoughts,
and many others, all passed through Miriam's mind as she stood
looking out from the mound upon the sundown moors.</p>

<p>Dreaming thus, she was startled by a well-known voice; and
looking in the direction whence the sound came, she saw her husband
in the distance beckoning her to meet him. Nor did she wait for his
further eager gesticulations, but at once, with fleet foot,
descended the slope, towards the path by which he was
approaching.</p>

<p>Ere she reached him, however, she realized as never before the
secret she was about to confide, and for the first time in her life
became self-conscious. How could she meet Matt, and how could she
tell him? In a moment her naturalness and girlish buoyancy forsook
her. She was lost in a distrait mood. Joy changed to shyness; a hot
flush, not of shame, but of
<a class="pagebreak" name="page257" id="page257" title="257"></a>
restraint, mounted her cheeks. Then she slackened her pace, and for
a moment wished that Matt could know all apart from her
confession.</p>

<p>To how many of nervous temperament is self-consciousness the bane
of existence&mdash;while the more such try to master it, the more
unnatural they become! It separates souls, begetting an aloofness
which, misunderstood, ends in mistrust and alienation; and it lies
at the root of too many of the fatal misconceptions of life. There
are loving hearts that would pay any price to be freed from the
self-enfolding toils that wrap them in these crisis hours. And so
would Miriam's, for she felt herself shrink within herself at the
approach of Matt. She knew nothing of mental moods, never having
heard of them, nor being able to account for, or analyze, them.  All
she knew, poor girl, was that for the first time in her life she was
not herself; and as she responded to Matt's warm greeting, she felt
she was not the wife, nor the woman, who but a few weeks ago had so
affectionately farewelled him, and who but a few moments ago so
longed for his return.</p>

<p>Nor was Matt unconscious of this change,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page258" id="page258" title="258"></a>
for as soon as the greeting was over he said, with tones of anxiety
in his voice:</p>

<p>&lsquo;What ails thee, my lass?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who sez as onnythin' ails me?&rsquo; was her reply, but in
a tone of such forced merriment that Matt only grew the more
concerned.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who sez as onnything ails thee?&rsquo; cried he.
&lsquo;Why those bonny een o' thine&mdash;an' they ne'er tell
lies.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Miriam was walking at his side, her dark eyes seeking the ground,
and half hidden by the droop of their long-fringed lids. Indeed, she
was too timid to flash their open searching light, as was her wont,
into the face of Matt; and when she did look at him, as at times she
was forced to, the glance was furtive and the gaze unsteady.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come, mi bonny brid (bird),&rsquo; said her husband,
betraying in his voice a deeper concern, &lsquo;tell thi owd mon
what's up wi thee. I've ne'er sin thee look like this afore. Durnd
look on th' grass so mich. Lift that little yed (head) o' thine.
Thaa's no need to be ashamed o' showing thi face&mdash;there's noan
so mony at's better lookin'&mdash;leastways, I've sin
noan.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page259" id="page259" title="259"></a>
<p>Miriam was silent; but as Matt's hand stole gently into hers, and
she felt the warm touch of his grasp, her heart leapt, and its
pent-up burden found outlet in a sob. Then he stayed his steps, and
looked at her, as a traveller would pause and look in wonderment at
the sudden portent in the heavens of a coming storm, and putting his
hand beneath the little drooping chin, he raised the pretty face to
find it wet with tears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay! nay! lass, thaa knows I conrot ston salt watter, when
it's i' a woman's een.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Miriam's tears fell all the faster</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'll tell yo' what it is, owd lass. I shornd hev to leave
yo' agen,&rsquo; and his arm stole round the little neck, and he
drew the sorrowful face to his own, and kissed it. &lsquo;But tell
yor owd mon what's up wi yo'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ne'er mind naa, Matt;
I'll&mdash;tell&mdash;thee&mdash;sometime,&rsquo; sobbed the
wife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I mun know naa, lass, or there'll be th' hangments to
play.  I'll be bun those hens o' Whittam's hes been rootin' up thi
flaars in th' garden. By gum! if they hev, I'll oather neck 'em, or
mak' him pay for th' lumber (mischief).&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page260" id="page260" title="260"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Nowe, lad&mdash;thaa'rt&mdash;mista'en&mdash;Whittam's
hens hesn't bin i' th' garden sin' thaa towd him abaat 'em
last.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then mi mother's bin botherin' thee agen,&rsquo; said
Matt, in a sharp tone, as though he had at last hit upon the secret
of his wife's sorrow.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wrang once more,&rsquo; replied Miriam, with a light in
her eye; and then, looking up at her husband with a gleam, she said:
&lsquo;I durnd think as thi mother'll bother me mich more,
lad.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Surely th' old lass isn't deead!&rsquo; he cried in
startled tones. And then, recollecting her treatment of Miriam, he
continued: &lsquo;But I needn't be afeard o' that, for thaa'll never
cry when th' old girl geets to heaven. Will yo', mi bonnie
un?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Shame on thee, Matt,&rsquo; said Miriam, smiling through
her tears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bless thee for that smile, lass. Thaa looks more thisel
naa.  There's naught like sunleet when it's in a woman's
face.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa means eyeleet,&rsquo; Miriam replied, with a gleam of
returning mirth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ony kind o' leet, so long as it's love-leet and joy-leet,
and i' thi face, an o'. But thaa's
<a class="pagebreak" name="page261" id="page261" title="261"></a>
noan towd me what made thee so feeard (timid) when aw met
thee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>By this time Matt and his wife were on the threshold of their
cottage, and the woman's heart beat loudly as she felt the moment of
her great confession was at hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Naa, come, Merry&rsquo; (he always called her Merry in the
higher moments of their domestic life)&mdash;&lsquo;come, Merry, no
secrets, thaa knows. There's naught ever come atween thee and me,
and if I can help, naught ever shall.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Miriam started, and once more wondered if the little life of
which Matt as yet knew nothing would come in between herself and
him, and divide them; or whether it would bind more closely their
already sacred union.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Naa, Merry,&rsquo; continued he, seating himself in the
rocking-chair, or &lsquo;courtin'-cheer,&rsquo; as he called it, and
drawing his blushing, yielding wife gently on his knee, &lsquo;naa,
Merry, whod is it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Cornd ta guess?&rsquo; asked she, hiding her face on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, lass; aw've tried th' hens and mi mother, and aw'm
wrang i' both, an' aw never
<a class="pagebreak" name="page262" id="page262" title="262"></a>
knew aught bother thee but t' one or t' other on 'em. Where mun I go
next?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Again there were tears in Miriam's eyes, and with one supreme
effort she raised her blushing face from Matt's shoulder to his
bushy whiskers, and burying her rosy lips near his ear, whispered
something, and then sank on his breast.</p>

<p>Then Matt drew his wife so closely to him that she bit her lips
to stifle the cry of pain that his love-clasp brought; and when he
let her go, it was that he might shower on her a rain of kisses,
diviner than had ever been hers in the seven happy years of their
past wedded life. For some minutes Matt sat with Miriam in his arms,
a spell of sanctity and silence filling the room. In that silence
both heard a voice&mdash;a little voice&mdash;preludious of the
music of heaven, and they peopled the light which haloed them with a
presence, childlike and pure. Then it was that Miriam looked up at
her husband and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Th' promise is not brokken, thaa sees, after all. It's to
us and to aar childer, for all thi mother hes said so mich abaat
it.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page263" id="page263" title="263"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Ey, lass,&rsquo; replied he, his manhood swept by emotion,
&lsquo;o' sich is the kingdom o' heaven.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And a gleam of firelight fell on the darkening wall, and lit up
an old text which hung there, and they both read, &lsquo;Children
are a heritage from God.&rsquo;</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>&lsquo;An' arto baan to keep it a secret, lass?&rsquo; asked
Matt, when once the spell of silence was broken.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why shouldn't I? There's no one as aw know as has any reet
to know but thee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But they'll noan be so long i' findin' it aat. Then
they'll never let us alone, lass. There'll be some gammin', aw con
tell thee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'm noan feared on 'em, Matt. I con stan' mi corner if
thaa con.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, a dozen corners naa, lass. Thaa knows it used to be
hard afore when they were all chaffin' me at th' factory, but they
can talk their tungs off naa for aught I care. But they'll soon find
it aat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;None as soon as thaa thinks, Matt. They've gan o'er
sperrin (being inquisitive) long sin',
<a class="pagebreak" name="page264" id="page264" title="264"></a>
and when they're off th' scent they're on th' wrang
scent.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw think aw'd tell mi mother, lass, if aw were
thee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let her find it aat, as t'others 'll hev to do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;As thaa likes, lass. But thaa knows hoo's fretted and
prayed and worrited hersel a deal abaat thee for mony a year. And if
hoo deed afore th' child were born we sud ne'er forgive
aarsels.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa'rt mebbe reet, lad. It'll pleaz her to know, and
hoo's bin a good mother to thee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi. Hoo's often said as if hoo could nobbud be a
gron'mother hoo'd say, as owd Simeon said, &ldquo;Mine een hev sin
Thy salvation.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, we'll go up and see her when th' chapel loses
to-morrow afternoon. Put that leet aat, lad; it's time we closed aar
een.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Matt turned down the lamp, and shot the bolt of his cottage door,
and followed his wife up the worn stone stairway to the room above,
to rest and await the dawning of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>That night, as the moonbeams fell in silver shafts through the
little window, and filled the chamber with a haze of subdued light,
a mystic
<a class="pagebreak" name="page265" id="page265" title="265"></a>
presence, unseen, yet felt, filled all with its glory. The old
four-poster rested like an ark in a holy of holies, its carved posts
of oak gleaming as the faces of watching angels on those whose weary
limbs were stretched thereon. The rugged features of Matt were
touched into grand relief, his hair and beard dark on the snowy
pillow and coverlet on which they lay. On his strong, outstretched
arm reposed she whom he so dearly, and now so proudly, loved, her
large, lustrous eyes looking out into the sheeted night, her pearly
teeth gleaming through her half-opened lips, from which came and
went her breath in the regular rhythm and sweetness of perfect
health. Long after her husband slept she lay awake, silently singing
her own &lsquo;Magnificat&rsquo;&mdash;not in Mary's words, it is
true, but with Mary's music and with Mary's heart.</p>

<p>And then she slept&mdash;and the moonbeams paled before the
sunrise, and the morning air stirred the foliage of the trees that
kissed the window-panes, and little birds came and sang their
matins, and another of God's Sabbaths spread its gold and glory over
the hills of Rehoboth.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page266" id="page266" title="266"></a>
<a name="chapter6.2" id="chapter6.2"></a>
<h3>II.</h3><h3>HOW DEBORAH HEARD THE NEWS.</h3>

<p>It was Sabbath on the moors&mdash;on the moors where it was
always Sabbath.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Morell used to say, &lsquo;For rest, commend me to these
eternal hills;&rsquo; and so Matt Heap thought as he threw open his
chamber casement and looked on their outline in the light of morning
glory. Their majesty and strength were so passionless, their repose
so undisturbed. How often he wondered to himself why they always
slept&mdash;not the sleep of weariness, but of strength! And how
often, when vexed and jaded, had he shared their calm as his eyes
rested on them, or as his feet sought their solitudes! How they
stirred the inarticulate poetry of his soul! At times he found
himself wondering if their sweeping lines were
<a class="pagebreak" name="page267" id="page267" title="267"></a>
broken arcs of a circle drawn by an infinite hand; and anon, he
would ask if their mighty mounds marked the graves of some primeval
age&mdash;mounds raised by the gods to the memory of forces long
since extinct.</p>

<p>As Matt looked at these hills, there rolled along their summits
snowy cumuli&mdash;billowy masses swept from distant cloud tempests,
and now spending their force in flecks of white across the blue
sky-sea that lay peaceful over awakening Rehoboth. A fresh wind
travelled from the gates of the sun, laden with upland sweets, and
mellowing moment by moment under the directer rays of the eastern
king; while the sycamores in the garden, as if in playful protest,
bent before the touch of its caress, only to rise and rustle as, for
the moment, they escaped the haunting and besetting breeze, lending
to their protest the dreamy play of light and shade from
newly-unsheathed leaves. There was a strange silence, too&mdash;a
silence that made mystic music in Matt's heart&mdash;a silence all
the more profound because of the distant low of oxen, and the strain
of an old Puritan hymn sung by a shepherd in a
<a class="pagebreak" name="page268" id="page268" title="268"></a>
neighbouring field.  Matt's heart was full, and, though he knew it
not, he was a worshipper&mdash;he was in the spirit on the Lord's
Day.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that thee, Matt?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lass, for sure it is. Who else should it be,
thinksto?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, I knew it were noabry but thee; but one mun say
summat, thaa knows. What arto doin' at th' winder? Has th' hens
getten in th' garden agen?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, not as aw con see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then what arto lookin' at? Thaa seems fair gloppened
(surprised).&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'm nobbud lookin' aat a bit. It's a bonny seet and o', I
can tell thee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa's sin' it mony a time afore, lad, hesn't ta? Is there
aught fresh abaat it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There's summat fresh i' mi een, awm thinkin'. Like as I
never seed th' owd country look as grand as it looks this
morn.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw'll hev a look wi' thee, Matt; ther'll happen be summat
fresh for my een and o'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And so saying, Miriam crept to his side and, in unblushing
innocence, took her stand at the window with Matt.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page269" id="page269" title="269"></a>
<p>It was a comely picture which the little birds saw as they
twittered round and peeped through the ivy-covered casement where
Matt and Miriam stood framed in the morning radiance and in the glow
of domestic love&mdash;she with loose tresses lying over her bare
shoulders, all glossy in the sunshine, her head resting on the
strong arm of him who owned her, and drew her in gentle pride to his
beating heart&mdash;the two together looking out in all the joy of
purity and all the unconscious ease of nature on the sun-flooded
moors.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's grand, lass, isn't it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, Matt, it is forsure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And them hills&mdash;they're awlus slumberin', am't they?
Doesto know, I sometimes wish I could be as quiet as they are. They
fret noan; weet or fine, it's all th' same to them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They're a bit o'er quiet for me, lad. I'd rather hev a
tree misel. It tosses, thaa knows, and tews i' th' tempest, and
laughs i' th' sunleet, and fades i' autumn. It's some like a human
bein' is a tree.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' aw sometimes think there's summat very like th'
Almeety i' th' hills.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page270" id="page270" title="270"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Doesto, Matt? Ey, aw shouldn't like to think He were so
far off as they are, nor as cowd (cold) noather.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, lass, they're noan so far off. Didn't owd David say,
&ldquo;As th' mountens are raand abaat Jerusalem, so th' Lord is
raand abaat His people&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He did, forsure. But didn't he say that a good man were
like a tree planted by th' brookside?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi; and he said summat else abaat a good woman, didn't he,
Miriam?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What were that, lad?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, didn't th' owd songster say, &ldquo;Thy wife shall be
as a fruitful vine by th' sides o' thine house, and thi childer like
olive plants raand abaat thy table&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Miriam blushed, and held up her lips to be kissed; nor did Matt
faintly warm them with his caresses.</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>That afternoon, as Matt and Miriam walked down the field-path
towards the Rehoboth shrine, they wondered how it was that so much
praise was rendered to the Almighty outside the temple
<a class="pagebreak" name="page271" id="page271" title="271"></a>
made with hands. Both of them had been taught to locate God in a
house.  Rehoboth chapel was His dwelling-place&mdash;not the earth
with the fulness thereof, and the heavens with their declaration of
glory.  Yet, somehow or other, they felt to-day that moor and meadow
were sacred&mdash;that their feet trod paths as holy as the worn
stone aisle of the conventicle below. The airs of spring swept round
them, carrying notes from near and far&mdash;whisperings from the
foliage of trees, and cadences from moors through whose herbage the
wind lisped, and from doughs down which it moaned. Early flowers
vied with the early greenery carpeting the fields, and the grass was
long enough to wave in shadow and intermingle its countless
glistening blades. Then their hearts went out towards Nature's
harmonies; and tears started to Miriam's eyes as the larks dropped
their music from the sunny heights. Now they passed patient oxen
looking out at them with quiet, impressive eyes, and the plaintive
bleat of the little lambs still brought many a throb to Miriam's
heart.</p>

<p>Turning down by the Clough, they met old Enoch and his wife, who,
though on their way
<a class="pagebreak" name="page272" id="page272" title="272"></a>
to Rehoboth, were so full of the spirit of the hour and the season
that they thought little of the bald ritual and barn-like sanctuary
that was drawing their steps.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is grond, lad,&rsquo; said Enoch to Matt, as he threw
back his shoulders to take a deep inspiration of the moorland air.
&lsquo;It's fair like a breath o' th' Almeety.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi; it's comin' fro' th' delectable mountains, for sure it
is.  I'm just thinkin' it's too fine to go inside this
afternoon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'll tell thee what, Matt, I know summat haa that lad
Jacob felt when he co'd th' moorside th' gate o' heaven.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ey, bless thee, Enoch, it wernd half as grand as
this!&rsquo; said his wife, as she plucked a spray of may blossom
from a hawthorn that overarched the path through the Clough.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mebbe not, lass; but aw know summat haa he felt
like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did it ever strike thee, Enoch, that there were a deal o'
mountain climbin' among th' owd prophets&mdash;like as they fun th'
Almeety on th' brow (hill)?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw never made much o' th' valleys, lad.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page273" id="page273" title="273"></a>
Them as lived in 'em hes bin a bad lot. We may well thank God as we
live up as high as we do. But I'll tell yo' what&mdash;we're baan to
be lat' for the service.  Step it aat, lasses.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On reaching the chapel yard, they found Amos Entwistle dismissing
his catechism class with a few words of warning as to deportment
during service, whilst old Joseph was busy cuffing the unruly lads
whose predilections for dodging round the gravestones overcame the
better instinct of reverence for the day and for the dead. Mr.
Penrose was just entering the vestry, and discordant sounds came
through the open door as of stringed instruments in process of
tuning.</p>

<p>The congregation was soon seated&mdash;a hardy race, reared on
the hills, and disciplined in the straitest of creeds. Stolid and
self-complacent, theirs was an unquestioning faith, accepting, as
they did, the Divine decrees as a Mohamedan accepts his fate. What
was, was right&mdash;all as it should be; elect, or non-elect,
according to the fore-knowledge, it was well. Sucking in their
theology with their mothers' milk, and cradled in sectarian
traditions, they loved justice
<a class="pagebreak" name="page274" id="page274" title="274"></a>
before mercy, and seldom walked humbly before God.  And yet these
Rehoboth mothers had borne and reared a strong
offspring&mdash;children hard, narrow, and self-righteous, yet of
firm fibre, and of real grit withal.</p>

<p>The mothers of Rehoboth were famous women, and bore the names of
the great Hebrew women of old. Among them were Leahs, Hannahs,
Hagars, and Ruths, yet none held priority to Deborah Heap, the
mother of Matt. Tall, gaunt, iron-visaged, with crisp, black locks
despite her threescore years, she was a prophetess among her
kindred&mdash;mighty in the Scriptures, and inflexible in faith.</p>

<p>Hers was the illustrious face of that afternoon's
congregation&mdash;the face a stranger would first fasten his eye
on, and on which his eye would remain; a face, too, he would fear.
History was writ large on every line, character had set its seal
there, and a crown of superb strength reposed on the brow. She
guarded the door of her pew, which door she had guarded since her
husband's death; and her deep-set eyes, glowing with suppressed
passion, never flinched in their gaze at the preacher. Now and again
the
<a class="pagebreak" name="page275" id="page275" title="275"></a>
thin nostrils dilated as Mr. Penrose smote down some of her idols;
but for this occasional sign her martyrdom was mute and
inexpressive.</p>

<p>No one loved Deborah Heap, although those who knew her measured
out to her degrees of respect. She was never known to wrong friend
or foe; and yet no kindly words ever fell from her lips, nor did
music of sympathy mellow her voice. Her life had been unrelieved by
a single deed of charity. She was, in old Mr. Morell's language,
&lsquo;a negative saint.&rsquo; Mr. Penrose went further, and called
her &lsquo;a Calvinistic pagan.&rsquo; But none of these things
moved her.</p>

<p>The grievance of her life was Matt's marriage with an alien; for
Miriam was a child of the Established Church. Great, too, was the
grievance that no children gladdened the hearth of the unequally
yoked couple; and this the old woman looked on as the curse of the
Almighty in return for her son's disobedience in sharing his lot
with the uncovenanted.</p>

<p>And yet Matt loved his mother; not, however, as he loved his
wife, for whom he held a tender, doating love, which the old woman
was quick to see, though silent to resent, save
<a class="pagebreak" name="page276" id="page276" title="276"></a>
when she said that &lsquo;Matt were fair soft o'er th' lass.&rsquo;
Nothing so pleased him as to be able to respect his mother's wish
without giving pain to his wife. Always loyal to Miriam, he sought
to be dutiful to Deborah, and, though the struggle was at times hard
and taxing, few succeeded better in holding a true balance of
behaviour between the twin relations of son and husband.</p>

<p>Now that Miriam had confided to him her secret, he felt sure his
mother's anger would be somewhat turned away when she, too, shared
it. And all through the afternoon service he moved restlessly, eager
for the hour when, at her own fireside, he could convey the glad
news to her ears.</p>

<p>And when that hour came, it came all too soon, for never were
Matt and Miriam more confused than when they faced each other at the
tea-table of Deborah. A painful repression was on them; ominous
silence sealed their lips, and they flushed with a heightened
colour. Matt's carefully-prepared speech forsook him&mdash;all its
prettiness and poetry escaped beyond recall; and Miriam was too
womanly to rescue him in his dilemma.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page277" id="page277" title="277"></a>
<p>&lsquo;It's some warm,&rsquo; said Matt, drawing his handkerchief
over his heated brow.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw durnd know as onybody feels it but thisel, lad,&rsquo;
replied his mother; &lsquo;but thaa con go i' th' garden, if thaa
wants to cool a bit. Tea's happen made thee sweat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then followed another painful pause, in which Miriam
unconsciously doubled up a spoon, on seeing which the old woman
reminded her that her &lsquo;siller wurnd for marlockin' wi' i' that
fashion&rsquo;; and no sooner had she administered this rebuke than
Matt overturned his tea.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are yo' two reet i' yor yeds (heads)?&rsquo; snapped his
mother. &lsquo;Yo' sit theer gawmless-like, one on yo' breakin' th'
spoons, and t'other turnin' teacups o'er. What's come o'er
yo'?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; stammered Matt, &lsquo;Miriam has summat to
tell yo'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, lad, thaa may tell it thisel,&rsquo; said Miriam.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Happen thaa cornd for shame, Miriam,&rsquo; stammered
Matt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I durnd know as I've ought to be ashamed on, but it seems
as though thaa hedn't th' pluck.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page278" id="page278" title="278"></a>
<p>The old woman grew impatient, and, supposing she was being
fooled, rose from the table, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want to know noan o' your secrets. I durnd know as I
ever axed for 'em, and if yo' wait till aw do, I shall never know
'em.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's happen one as yo'd like to know, though,
mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's happen one as you'd like to tell, lad,&rsquo; replied
the old woman, softening.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, if we durnd tell yo', yo'll know soon enough, for
it's one o' them secrets as willn't keep&mdash;will it,
Miriam?&rsquo; asked Matt of his blushing wife.</p>

<p>But Miriam was silent, and refused to lift her face from the
pattern of the plate over which she bent low.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dun you think yor too owd to be a gronmother?&rsquo; asked
Matt of his parent, growing in boldness as he warmed to his
confession.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I were thee I'd ax mysel if I were young enugh to be a
faither, that I would,&rsquo; said the old woman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I shall happen be one afore so long, shornd I,
Miriam?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page279" id="page279" title="279"></a>
<p>But tears were streaming from Miriam's eyes, and she answered
not.</p>

<p>And then there dawned on the mind of Deborah the cause of her
son's confusion, and a light stole across the hard lines of her face
as she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that it, lad? Thank God! thaa'rt in th' covenant after
all.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page280" id="page280" title="280"></a>
<a name="chapter6.3" id="chapter6.3"></a>
<h3>III.</h3><h3>&lsquo;IT'S A LAD!&rsquo;</h3>

<p>&lsquo;Naa, Matt, put on thi coite and fotch th' doctor, an tak'
care thaa doesn't let th' grass grow under thi feet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Matt needed no second bidding. In a moment he was ready, and
before the old nurse turned to re-ascend the chamber stairs the
faithful fellow was on his way towards the village below.</p>

<p>It was a morning in November, and as Matt hurried along he passed
many on their way to a day's work at the Bridge Factory in the vale.
Most of them knew him, dark though it was, and greeting him, guessed
the errand on which he raced. Once or twice he collided with those
who were slow to get out of his path, and almost overturned old Amos
Entwistle into
<a class="pagebreak" name="page281" id="page281" title="281"></a>
the goit as he pushed past him on the bank that afforded the nearest
cut to the village.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Naa, lad, who arto pushin' agen, and where arto baan i'
that hurry? Is th' haase o' fire, or has th' missus taan her
bed?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Matt was beyond earshot before the old man finished his rude
rebuke.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of his journey Matt's mind was a prey to
wild and foreboding passion&mdash;passion largely the product of a
rude and superstitious mind. Questions painful, if not foolish,
haunted and tormented him. Would Miriam die? Had not the seven years
of their past life been too happy to last? Did not his mother once
reverse the old Hebrew proverb, and warn him that a night of weeping
would follow a morning of joy? Would Heaven be avenged on his
occasional fits of discontent, and grant him his wish for a child at
the cost of the life of his wife? He had heard how the Almighty
discounted His gifts; how selfish men had to pay dearly for what
they wrenched against the will of God. As he hurried, these thoughts
followed on as fleet feet as his own, and moaned their voices in his
ears with the sounds of the wind.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page282" id="page282" title="282"></a>
<p>It was not long before he reached Dr. Hale's door, where he so
lustily rung, that an immediate response was given to his summons,
the man of science putting his head through the window and asking in
peremptory tones who was there.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's me, doctor&mdash;me&mdash;Matt, yo' know&mdash;Matt
Heap&mdash;th' missis is i' bed, and some bad an' o'. Ne'er mind
dressin'. Come naa;&rsquo; and the half-demented man panted for
breath.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'll be with you in a minute, Matt. Don't lose your head,
that's a good fellow,&rsquo; and so saying, the doctor withdrew to
prepare for the journey.</p>

<p>To Matt, the doctor's minute seemed unending. He shuffled his
feet impatiently along the gravel-path, and beat a tattoo with his
fingers on the panels of the door, muttering under his breath words
betraying an impatient and agitated mind; and when at last the
doctor joined him, ready for departure, the strain of suspense was
so great that both tears and sobs wrung themselves from his
overstrained nature.</p>

<p>The two men walked along in silence, Matt
<a class="pagebreak" name="page283" id="page283" title="283"></a>
being too timid to question the doctor, the doctor not caring to
give Matt the chance of worrying him with foolish fears. Now and
again Matt in his impatience tried to lead the doctor into a run,
but in this the self-possessed man checked him, knowing that he
covered the most ground who walked with an even step. For a little
time Matt submitted to the restraint without a murmur. At last,
however, his patience failed him, and he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do yo' never hurry, doctor?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sometimes, Matt&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And when is those times, doctor?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They're bad times, Matt&mdash;times of emergency, you
know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' durnd yo' think my missis is hevin' a bad time up at
th' cottage yonder? I welly think yo' might hurry up a bit, doctor.
You'll geet paid for th' job, yo' know. I'm noan afraid o' th'
brass.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Hale laughed at the importunity of Matt, but knowing the
doggedness of the man, somewhat quickened his steps, assuring his
impatient companion that all would be well. The doctor soon,
however, regretted his easy-going
<a class="pagebreak" name="page284" id="page284" title="284"></a>
optimism, for on mounting the brow before the cottage, Malachi o'
th' Mount's wife met him, and running out towards him, said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hurry up, doctor; thaa'rt wanted badly, I con tell thee.
Hoo's hevin' a bad time on't, and no mistak'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It did not take the doctor long to see that his patient was in
the throes of a crisis, and with a will he set about his trying
work, all the more confident because he knew the two women by his
side were experienced hands&mdash;hands on whom he could rely in
hours of emergency such as the one he was now called to face.</p>

<p>As for Matt, he sat in the silent kitchen with his feet on the
fender and an unlighted pipe between his teeth. The morning sun had
long since crossed the moors, but its light brought no joy to his
eyes&mdash;with him, all was darkness. He heard overhead the
occasional tread of the doctor's foot, and the movements of the
ministering women, while occasionally one of them would steal
quietly down for something needed by the patient above. Between
these breaks&mdash;welcome breaks to Matt&mdash;the silence became
<a class="pagebreak" name="page285" id="page285" title="285"></a>
distressful, and the suspense a burden. Why that hush? What was
going on in those fearful pauses? Could they not tell him how Miriam
was? Was he not her husband, and had he not a right to know of her
who was his own? By what right did the women&mdash;good and kind
though they were&mdash;step in between himself and her whom he loved
dearer than life? And as these questions pressed him he rose to
climb the stairway and claim a share in ministering to the
sufferings of the one who was his own. But when he reached the foot
he paused, his nerve forsook him, and he trembled like a leaf
beneath the breeze. Straining his ear, he listened, but no sound
came save a coaxing and encouraging word from the old nurse, or a
brief note of instruction from Dr. Hale. Should he call her by her
name? Should he address her as Merry, the pet name which he only
addressed to her? He opened his lips, but his tongue lay heavy. He
could scarcely move it, and as he moved it in his attempt to speak,
he heard its sound as it parted from, or came in contact with, the
dry walls of his mouth. How long he could have borne this suspense
<a class="pagebreak" name="page286" id="page286" title="286"></a>
it would be hard to say, had he not heard his mother's voice at the
kitchen-door calling.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that yo', mother?&rsquo; said Matt, dragging himself
from the foot of the stairway leading to the chamber above.
&lsquo;Is that yo'?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ey, Matt, whatever's to do wi' thee; aw never see thee
look like that afore. Is Miriam bad, or summat?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, mother, they willn't tell me. But go yo' upstairs,
and when you've sin for yorsel come daan and tell me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Old Deborah took her son's advice, and went upstairs to where the
suffering woman lay pale and prostrate. She saw, by a glance at the
doctor's face, that he was more than anxious, while the mute signs
of the nurse and Malachi o' th' Mount's wife confirmed her worst
suspicions.</p>

<p>During his mother's absence there returned on Matt the horrible
suspense which her visit had in part enabled him to throw off.  Once
more he felt the pressure of the silence, and the room in which he
sat became haunted with a terrible vacancy&mdash;a vacancy cold and
shadowy with an unrelieved gloom. There all round
<a class="pagebreak" name="page287" id="page287" title="287"></a>
him were the familiar household gods; there they stood in their
appointed places, but where was the hand that ruled them, the deity
that gave grace to that domestic kingdom of the moors? He looked for
the shadow of her form as it was wont to fall on the hearth, but
there was only a blank. He lent his ear to catch the voice so often
raised in merry snatch of song, but not the echo of a sound greeted
him. There was a room only, swept and garnished, but empty. Then he
thought of the great drama of life which was being enacted in the
chamber overhead, and he asked himself why the hours were so many
and why they walked with such leaden feet.  There was she, his
Merry, torn between the forces of life and death, giving of her own
that she might perpetuate life, and braving death that life might be
its lord&mdash;there was she, fighting alone! save for the feeble
help of science and the cheer and succour of kindly care, while he,
strong man that he was, sat there, powerless, his very impotence
mocking him, and his groans and anguish but the climax of his
despair.</p>

<p>In a little while Matt's mother came downstairs
<a class="pagebreak" name="page288" id="page288" title="288"></a>
with hopelessness written on every line of her hard face.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa'll hev to mak' up thi mind to say good-bye to Miriam,
lad.  Hoo's noan baan to howd aat much longer. Hoo's abaat done,
poor lass!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yo' mornd talk like that to me, mother, or I'll put yo'
aat o' the haase. I'm noan baan to say good-bye to Merry yet, by
&mdash;&mdash; I' ammot!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, lad, thaa's no need to be either unnatural nor
blasphemous o'er th' job. What He wills, He wills, thaa knows; and
if thaa willn't bend, thaa mun break.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I'll do noather, mother. Miriam's noan baan to dee
yet, I con tell yo'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Just then Dr. Hale descended from the chamber, and beckoning
Matt, whispered in his ear that he deemed it right to tell him that
he feared the worst would overtake his wife, and that she would like
to see him.</p>

<p>The words came to Matt as the first great blow of his life. True,
he had anticipated the worst; but now that it came it was tenfold
more severe than his anticipation. Looking
<a class="pagebreak" name="page289" id="page289" title="289"></a>
at Dr. Hale with eyes too dry for tears, he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw connot see her, doctor; aw connot see her. Yo' an' th'
women mun do yor best; and don't forget to ax the Almighty to help
yo'.&rsquo; And so saying, Matt went out in despair into the wild
November day.</p>

<p>As he rushed into the raw air the wind dashed the rain in his
face as though to beat him back within his cottage home. Heedless of
these, however, he pressed forward, wild with grief, seeking to lose
his own madness amid the whirl and confusion of the storm.
Low-lying, angry clouds seethed round the summits of the distant
hills, and mists, like shrouds, hung over the drear and leafless
cloughs. The moorland grasses lay beaten and colourless&mdash;great
swamps&mdash;reservoirs where lodged the moisture of a long autumn's
rain, while the roads were limp and sodden, and heavy for the
wayfarer's foot. But Matt was heedless of these; and striking a
drift path that crossed the hills, he followed its trend. Along it
he walked&mdash;nay, raced rather, like a man pursued. And pursued
he was; for he sought in vain to escape <a class="pagebreak"
name="page290" id="page290" title="290"></a> the passions that
preyed on him, tormenting him. Sorrow, anguish, death; these were at
his heels; and, worse than all, he thought his dying wife was
following him, pleading for his return. Why had he forsaken her?
Was it not cowardice&mdash;the cowardice and selfishness of his
grief?  Once or twice a fascination took hold of him, and, despite
the terror that awed him, he threw a glance over his shoulder to see
if after all he were pursued by the shadow he so much feared to
meet. Then the wind began to utter strange sounds&mdash;wailings and
lamentations&mdash;its burden being a wild entreaty to return; and
once he thought he heard an infant's cry, and he paused in his
despair.</p>

<p>A steep and rugged path lay before him&mdash;a path that led
under trees whose swaying branches flung off raindrops in blinding
showers, and a gleam of light shot shaft-like from a rift in the
sombre clouds, and falling across his feet, led him to wonder how
heaven could shed a fitful smile on sorrow like his own.</p>

<p>Familiar with the moods of nature, he deemed the hour to be that
of noon; nor was he mistaken,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page291" id="page291" title="291"></a>
for the sky began to clear, and with the light came the return to a
calmer mind. He now, for the first time, realized the
folly&mdash;probably the disaster&mdash;of his flight.  Might he not
be needed at the cottage? Was not his dying wife's prayer for his
presence and succour? Had not an unmanly selfishness led him to play
the coward? Thoughts like these led him to marshal his resolves, and
turn his steps towards the valley below.</p>

<p>No sooner did he do this than a strong self-possession came to
him, and swift was his return. The clouds were now parting, and as
they chased one another towards the distant horizon, the
sun&mdash;the watery November sun&mdash;shone out in silver upon the
great stretch of moorland, and lit it up like a sea of light. Little
globes of crystal glistened on the hedgerows, and many-coloured
raindrops glowed like jewelled points on the blades of green that
lay about his feet. A great arch of sevenfold radiance spanned the
valley, based on either side from the twin slopes, and reaching with
its crown to the summit of the skies. It was now a passage from
Hebrew tradition came to his
<a class="pagebreak" name="page292" id="page292" title="292"></a>
mind, and he thought of him of whom the poet wrote, &lsquo;and as he
passed over Penuel, the sun rose upon him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And yet his heart failed him as he drew within sight of the
cottage door. Was it the house of life, or the house of
death?&mdash;or was it the house where death and life alike were
victorious? He paused, and felt the blood flow back to its central
seat, while his bones began to shake, and his heart was poured out
like water.  But the battle was won, though the struggle was not
over, and he pressed on towards his home.</p>

<p>The first thing he saw on entering the door was Dr. Hale seated
before a cup of steaming tea, with a great weariness in his eye,
who, when he saw Matt, threw a look of rebuke, and in somewhat stern
tones said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You can go upstairs, Matt, if you like; it's all
over.&rsquo;</p>

<p>With a spasm in his throat Matt was about to ask what it was that
was all over; but he was forestalled by old Malachi's wife, who,
pushing her head through the staircase doorway into the room,
cried:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page293" id="page293" title="293"></a>
<p>&lsquo;It's a lad, Matt, and a fine un an' o'!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hang th' lad!&rsquo; cried Matt; &lsquo;how's
Miriam?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come and see for thisel; hoo's bin waitin' for thee this
hawve haar.&rsquo;</p>

<p>With a bound or two Matt cleared the stairway and stood by the
side of Miriam.</p>

<p>There she lay, poor girl! limp and exhausted, wrapped in her old
gown like a mummy, her long, wet hair, which was scattered in
tresses on the pillow, throwing, in its dark frame, her face into
still greater pallor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa munnot speak, Miriam,&rsquo; said the nurse in a low
tone. &lsquo;If thaa moves tha'll dee. Thaa can kiss her, Matt; but
that's all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Matt kissed his wife, and baptized her with his warm tears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And hesn't thaa getten a word for th' child, Matt?&rsquo;
cried old Deborah, who sat with a pulpy form upon her knees before
the fire.  &lsquo;It's thy lad and no mistak'; it favours no one but
thisel. Look at its yure (hair), bless it!&rsquo; And old Deborah
stooped over it and wept. Wept&mdash;which she had never done since
her girlhood's days.</p>

<p>But Matt's eyes were fixed on Miriam, until
<a class="pagebreak" name="page294" id="page294" title="294"></a>
she, breaking through the orders of the doctor, said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Matt, do look at th' baby&mdash;it's thine, thaa
knows.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And then Matt looked at the baby. For the first time in his life
he looked at a new-born baby, and at a baby to whom he was linked by
ties of paternity, and his heart went out towards the little
palpitating prophecy of life&mdash;so long expected, and perfected
at such a price. And he took it in his arms, while old Deborah
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa sees, lad, God's not forgetten to be gracious. Th'
promise is still to us and aars.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Malachi's wife sent Matt downstairs, saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;We'n had enugh preachin' and cryin'. Go and ged on wi' thi
wark.  Th' lass is on th' mend, and hoo'll do gradely
weel.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page295" id="page295" title="295"></a>
<a name="chapter6.4" id="chapter6.4"></a>
<h3>IV.</h3><h3>THE LEAD OF THE LITTLE ONE.</h3>

<p>The child grew, and its first conquest was the heart of old
Deborah. Before the little life she bowed, and what her Calvinistic
creed was weak to do for her, a love for her grandson accomplished.
Often and long would she look into his face as he lay in her arms,
until at last she, too, caught the child-feature and the
child-smile. Rehoboth said old Deborah was renewing her youth; for
she had been known to laugh and croon, and more than once purse up
her old lips to sing a snatch of nursery rhyme&mdash;a thing which
in the past she had denounced as tending to &lsquo;mak' childer
hush't wi' th' songs o' sin.&rsquo; The hard look died away from her
eyes, and her mouth ceased to wear its sealed and drawn expression.
The voice, too, became low and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page296" id="page296" title="296"></a>
mellow, and her religion, instead of being that of the Church, was
now that of the home.</p>

<p>One morning, while carrying the child through the meadows, she
was overtaken by Amos Entwistle, who stopped her, saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tak' care, Deborah, tak' care, or the Almeety will
overthrow thi idol. Thaa'rt settin' thi affections on things o' th'
earth; and He'll punish thee for it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' do yo' co this babby one o' th' things o' th'
earth?&rsquo; cried the old woman fiercely.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, forsure I do. What else mut it be?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look yo' here, Amos,&rsquo; said Deborah, raising the
child in her arms so that her rebuker might look into its little
features, ruddy and reposeful&mdash;features where God's fresh touch
still lingered; &lsquo;luk yo' here. Han yo' never yerd that
childer's angels awlus behold th' face o' their Faither
aboon?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Eh! Deborah, lass, aw never thought as Mr. Penrose ud turn
thi yed and o'. Theer's a fearful few faithful ones laft i' Zion
naa-a-days. Bud aw tell thee, th' Lord'll smite thi idol, and it'll
be thro' great tribulation that tha'll enter th' Kingdom.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page297" id="page297" title="297"></a>
<p>&lsquo;I'd ha' yo' to know, Amos Entwistle, that I'm noan in yor
catechism class, an' I'm noan baan to be. Yo' can tak' an' praitch
yor rubbidge somewheer else. Yo've no occasion to come to me, I con
tell yo'.&rsquo; And then, looking down at the reposeful little
face, she kissed it, and continued, &lsquo;Did he co thee an idol,
my darlin'? Ne'er heed him, owd powse ud he is!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Before nightfall Deborah's encounter with Amos was the talk of
Rehoboth, and it was freely reported that the old woman had become
an infidel. Whether the cause of her infidelity resulted from Mr.
Penrose's preaching or the advent of her grandchild was a disputed
point. Old Amos declared, however, &lsquo;that there were a bit o'
both in it, but he feared th' chilt more than th' parson.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Deborah's first great spiritual conflict&mdash;as they called it
in Rehoboth&mdash;was when her grandchild cut its first teeth. The
eye of the grandmother had been quick to note a dulness and
sleepiness in the baby&mdash;strange to a child of so lively and
observant a turn&mdash;and judging that the incisors were parting
the gums, she
<a class="pagebreak" name="page298" id="page298" title="298"></a>
wore her finger sore with rubbing the swollen integuments.</p>

<p>One morning, as she was continuing these operations, she felt the
child stiffen on her knee, and looking, saw the little eyes glide
and roll as though drawn by a power foreign to the will. A
neighbour, who was hastily called, declared it to be convulsions,
and for some hours the little life hung in the balance. It was
during these hours that Deborah fought her first and only great
fight with Him whom she had been taught to address as &lsquo;th'
Almeety.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ever since her conflict with Amos, she could not free her mind
from superstitious thoughts about &lsquo;the idol.&rsquo; Did she
love the child overmuch, and would her over-love be punished by the
child's death? She had heard and read of this penalty which the
Almighty imposed upon those who loved the creature more than the
Creator; and she, poor soul, to hinder this, had tried to love both
the Giver and the gift. Nay, did she not love the Giver all the
more, because she loved the gift so much? This was the question that
vexed her. Why had God given
<a class="pagebreak" name="page299" id="page299" title="299"></a>
her something to love if He did not mean her to love it?&mdash;and
could she love too much what God had given? Once she put this
question to Mr. Penrose, and his reply lived in her mind: &lsquo;If
there is no limit to God's love of us, why should we fear to love
one another too dearly or too well?&rsquo; But now the test had
come. The child was in danger; a shadow fell on the idol. Was it the
shadow of an angry God&mdash;a God insulted by a divided love?</p>

<p>It was in the torturing hold of questions such as these that she
once more met Amos, who, laying the flattering unction to his soul
that he could forgive his enemies, struck a stab straight at her
heart by saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, Deborah, th' chilt's dying, I yer. I towd thee he
would.  Th' Almeety goes hawves wi' no one. He'll hev all or
noan.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What! doesto mak' aat He's as selfish as thisel, Amos?
Nay, I mun hev a better God nor thee.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, a' tell thee, He's baan to tak' th' lad, so thaa mut
as weel bow to His will. Them as He doesn't bend He
breaks.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then He'll hev to break me, Amos; for aw
<a class="pagebreak" name="page300" id="page300" title="300"></a>
shall never bend, aw con tell thee.&rsquo; And the old woman
stiffened herself, as though in defiance of the Providence which
Amos preached.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, Deborah, thaa'rt wur nor a potsherd. Thaa knows thi
Bible: &ldquo;Let the potsherds strive wi' th' potsherds; but woe to
th' mon that strives wi' his Maker.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I'm baan to wrostle wi' Him, an' if He flings me aw
shannot ax yo' to pick me up, noather.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa mun say, &ldquo;Thy will be done,&rdquo;
Deborah.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe! never to th' deeath o' yon chilt.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Doesto say thaa willn't?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, Amos, aw do!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Amos turned away, groaning in spirit at the rebellious
hearts of the children of men.</p>

<p>The child came safely through the convulsions, however, and as
the sharp edges of the little teeth gleamed through the gums, the
old woman would rub her finger over them until she felt the smart,
and with tearful eye thank God for the gift He had spared, as well
as for the gift He had granted&mdash;little dreaming that as she
nursed her treasure she nursed also her
<a class="pagebreak" name="page301" id="page301" title="301"></a>
mentor&mdash;one who, though in the feebleness of infancy, was
drawing her back to a long-lost childhood, and bidding return to her
the days of youth.</p>

<p>The old grandmother now became the light of Matt and Miriam's
home. Instead of paying the occasional visit at her house, she was
ever at theirs&mdash;indeed, she could not rest away from the child.
Miriam long since had ceased to fear her. &lsquo;The little
un,&rsquo; as she used to tell Matt, &lsquo;had drawed th' owd
woman's teeth;&rsquo; to which Matt used to reply, &lsquo;Naa, lass,
the teeth's there, but hoo's gi'en o'er bitin'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Not infrequently, both son and daughter would rally her on the
many indulgences she granted the child, and Matt often told her that
what &lsquo;he used to ged licked for, th' chilt geet kissed
for.&rsquo; Mr. Penrose, too, ventured to discuss theology with Matt
in the old woman's presence, and she no longer eyed him with angry
fire as he discoursed from the Rehoboth pulpit on the larger hope.
As for Amos Entwistle, he continued to prophesy the death of the
child, and when it still lived and throve, in spite of his
prediction, he contented himself by saying that &lsquo;Deborah
<a class="pagebreak" name="page302" id="page302" title="302"></a>
hed turned the Owd Testament blessin' into a curse.&rsquo;</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<p>On Sunday afternoons Matt and Miriam would leave the boy at his
grandmother's while they went to the service at Rehoboth. Then it
was the old woman took down the family Bible, and showed to him the
plates representative of the marvels of old. These began to work on
the child's imagination; and once, when the book lay open at
Revelation, he fastened his little eyes on a hideous representation
of the bottomless pit.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What's that, gronny?&rsquo; said he, pointing to the
picture.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That, mi lad, is th' hoile where all th' bad fo'k
go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who dug it? Did owd Joseph, gronny?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, lad; owd Joseph nobbud digs hoiles for fo'k's
bodies. That hoile is fer their souls.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What's them, gronny?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, lad! A connot tell thee reet&mdash;but it's summat
abaat us as we carry wi' us&mdash;summat, thaa knows, that never
dees.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page303" id="page303" title="303"></a>
<p>&lsquo;And why do they put it in a hoile, gronny? Is it to mak'
it better?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, lad; they put it i' th' hoile because it's noan
good.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then it's summat like mi dad when I'm naughty, an' he says
he'll put me i' th' cellar hoile.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But he never does&mdash;does he, lad?&rsquo; asked the
grandmother anxiously.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, gronny. He nobbud sez he will.&rsquo; And then,
after a pause, he continued, &lsquo;But, gronny, if God sez He'll
put 'em in He'll do as He sez&mdash;willn't He?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lad; He will, forsure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' haa long does He keep 'em in when He gets 'em theer?
Till to-morn t'neet?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Longer lad.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Till Kesmas?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lad.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Longer nor Kesmas?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lad. But ne'er heed. Here's summat to eat. Sithee, I
baked thee a pasty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I noan want th' pasty, gronny. I want to yer abaat th'
hoile. Haa long does God keep bad fo'k in it?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page304" id="page304" title="304"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Ey, lad. I wish thaa'd hooisht! What doesto want botherin'
thi little yed wi' such like talk?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Haa long does He keep 'em i' th' hoile?&rsquo;
persistently asked the boy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, if thaa mun know, He keeps 'em in for
ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' haa long's that, gronny? Is it as long as
thee?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;As long as me, lad! Whatever doesto mean?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I mean is forever as long as thaa'rt owd? Haa owd arto,
gronny?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'm sixty-five, lad.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, does He keep 'em i' the hoile sixty-five
years?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lad. He does, forsure. But thi faither never puts thee
i' th' cellar hoile when thaa's naughty, does he?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe. I tell thee he nobbud sez he will,&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;By Guy, lad! If ever he puts thee i' th' cellar
hoile&mdash;whether thaa'rt naughty or not&mdash;thaa mun tell me,
and I'll lug his yed for him.&rsquo; And the old woman became
indignant in her mien.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page305" id="page305" title="305"></a>
<p>&lsquo;But if God puts fo'k i' th' hoile, why shuldn't mi faither
put me i' th' hoile? It's reet to do as God does&mdash;isn't it,
gronny?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whatever wilto ax me next, lad?&rsquo; cried the worn-out
and perplexed old woman. &lsquo;Come, shut up th' Bible, and eat thi
pasty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the little fellow's appetite was gone, and as he fell asleep
on the settle his slumber was fitful, for dark dreams disturbed
him&mdash;he had felt the first awful shadow of a dogmatic
faith.</p>

<p>Nor was old Deborah less disturbed. Sitting by the fire, with one
eye on the child and the other on her Bible, the gloomy shadows of a
shortening day creeping around her, she, too, with her mind's eye,
saw the regions of woe&mdash;the flaming deeps where hope comes
never. What if that were her grandchild's doom!&mdash;her
grandchild, whose father she would smite if even for a moment he
shut his little son up in the cellar of his home! How her heart
loathed the passion, the cruelty, that would wreak such an act! And
yet He whom she called God had reserved blackness and darkness for
ever for the disobedient and rebellious.</p>

<p>Horror took hold of her, and the sweat moistened
<a class="pagebreak" name="page306" id="page306" title="306"></a>
her brow. The firelight played on the curls of the sleeping boy, and
she started as she thought of that other fire that was never
quenched, and she rose and shook her clenched hand at heaven as the
possibility of the singeing of a single hair of the child passed
through her mind.</p>

<p>For a time Deborah stood alone, without a God, the faith in which
she had been trained, and in which she had sheltered in righteous
security, shrinking into space until she found herself in the void
of a darkness more terrible than that of the pit which she had been
speaking of to the child. She saw how that hitherto she had only
believed she believed, and that now, when her soul was touched in
its nether deeps, she had never believed at all in the creed which
she had fought for and upheld with such bitterness.  There, in the
twilight of that Sabbath evening, she uttered what, to Rehoboth,
would have been a terrible renunciation, just as a lurid beam shot
its level fire across the moors, and as the sun went down, leaving
her in the horror of a great darkness.</p>

<p>And then, in the gathering gloom, was heard the voice of the
child calling:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page307" id="page307" title="307"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Gronny! Gronny!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, mi lad, what is't?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gronny, I don't believe i' th' hoile.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bless thee, my darlin'&mdash;no more do I.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I durnd think as God ud send me where yo' an' mi dad
wouldn't let me go&mdash;would He, gronny?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, lad, He wouldn't, forsure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And then, lighting the lamp, and turning with the old
superstition to her Bible to see what the law and the testimony had
to say as she opened it at random, her eyes fell on the words:
&lsquo;If ye, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven
give good things to them that ask Him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That afternoon, when Matt and Miriam returned from Rehoboth, they
found old Deborah less than the little child she watched over; for
she, too, had not only become as a little child, but, as she said,
least among the little ones.</p>

<h2>VII.</h2><h2>HOW MALACHI O' TH' MOUNT WON HIS WIFE.</h2>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page310" id="page310" title="310"></a>
<a class="pagebreak" name="page311" id="page311" title="311"></a>
<p>&lsquo;So yo' want to know haa aw geet hand o' my missus, dun
yo', Mr.  Penrose? Well, if hoo'll nobbud be quiet while aw'm abaat
it, aw'll tell yo'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And so saying, Malachi drew his chair to the fire, and blew a
cloud of tobacco-smoke towards the rows of oat-cakes that hung on
the brade fleygh over his head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It's forty year sin' I furst wore shoe-leather i'
Rehoboth, Mr.  Penrose.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, lad, it's noan forty year whol Candlemas. It were
February, thaa knows, when thaa come; and it's nobbud October yet.
An' thaa didn't wear shoon noather, thaa wore clogs&mdash;clogs as
big as boats, Mr. Penrose; an' they co'd him Clitter-clatter for a
nickname.  Hasto forgetten, Malachi?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page312" id="page312" title="312"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Aw wish thaa wouldn't be so plaguey partic'lar, lass, an'
let a felley get on wi' his tale,&rsquo; said Malachi to his wife.
And then, turning to Mr. Penrose, he continued: &lsquo;Aw were
tryin' to say as it were forty year sin' I come to
Rehoboth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Forty year come Candlemas, Malachi.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, forty year come Candlemas. Aw were bred and born aboon
Padiham, an' aw come to th' Brig Factory as cut-looker, an' never
laft th' job till aw went to weighin' coil on th' pit
bonk.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All but that eighteen month thaa were away i' Yorksur,
when th' cotton panic were on, thaa knows, lad.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, lass, aw know. Naa let me ged on wi' mi tale. Well, as
aw were sayin', Mr. Penrose, I come in these parts as cut-looker at
th' Brig Factory, and th' fust lass as brought her piece to me were
Betty yonder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thaa'rt wrang agen, Malachi. Th' fust lass as brought her
piece to thee were Julia Smith. Aw remember as haa hoo went in afore
me, as though it were nobbud yester morn.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, never mind, thaa wur t' fust I seed, an' that's near
enugh, isn't it, Mr. Penrose?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page313" id="page313" title="313"></a>
<p>The minister nodded, and smiled at old Betty, who so jealously
followed the story of her husband's early life.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, when hoo put her piece daan afore me, I couldn't
tak' mi een off her. Aw were fair gloppent (taken by surprise), an'
aw did naught but ston' an' stare at her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What arto starin' at?&rdquo; hoo said, flushin' up
to her yure (hair).</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;At yo',&rdquo; I said, as gawmless as a nicked
goose.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then thaa'd better use thi een for what th'art paid
for, an' look at them pieces i'stead o' lookin' at lasses'
faces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And hoo walked aat o' th' warehaase like a queaan. An' dun
yo' remember, Betty, haa th' young gaffer laffed at me, an' said as
aw could noan play wi' th' likes o' yo'?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi, aw remember, Malachi; but ged on wi' yor tale. Mr.
Penrose here is fair plagued.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Indeed, I'm not. Go on, Malachi. Take your own time, and
tell your story in your own fashion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw will, Mr. Penrose, if hoo'll nobbud let me. Betty were
a four-loom weyver; and i'
<a class="pagebreak" name="page314" id="page314" title="314"></a>
those days there wernd so many lasses as could tackle th' job. An'
th' few that could were awlus piked up pratty quick for
wives&mdash;for them as married 'em had no need to work theirsels,
and had lots o' time on their hands for laking (playing) and
such-like. Bud that wernd th' reason aw made up to Betty. It wernd
th' looms that fetched me; it were her een.  There's some breetness
in 'em yet; bud yo' should ha' sin 'em forty years sin'! They leeted
up her bonnie cheeks like dewdrops i' roses; an' noabry 'at looked
i' them could see ought wrang i' 'em.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Malachi, if thaa doesn't hold thi tung I'll smoor
(smother) thee wi' this stockin'. Thaa'rt as soft as when thaa were
a lad;&rsquo; and the old woman held up the article of clothing that
she was darning in her hand, and shook it in a threatening manner at
her eloquent spouse.</p>

<p>&lsquo;In a bit, Mr. Penrose, I geet as I couldn't for shame to
look into Betty's een at all; an' then aw took to blushin' every
time hoo come i' th' warehouse wi' her pieces, an' when hoo spoke,
aw trembled all o'er like a barrow full o' size. One day hoo'd a
float in her piece, and
<a class="pagebreak" name="page315" id="page315" title="315"></a>
aw couldn't find it i' mi heart to bate her. And when th' manager
fun it aat, he said if I'd gone soft o'er Betty, it were no reason
why aw should go soft o'er mi wark, and he towd me to do mi courtin'
i' th' fields and not i' th' factory. But it were yeasier said nor
done, aw can tell yo', for Betty were a shy un, and bided a deal o'
gettin' at.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There used to be a dur (door) leadin' aat o' th' owd
warehaase into th' weyvin' shed, an' one day aw get a gimlik an'
bored a hoile so as aw could peep thro' an' see Betty at her wark.
It wernd so often as aw'd a chance, bud whenever th' manager's back
were turned, an' aw were alone, I were noan slow to tak' my chance.
It were wheer I could just see Betty at her looms. Bless thee, lass,
aw think aw can see thee naa, bendin' o'er thi looms wi' a neck as
praad as a swan's, thi fingers almost as nimble as th' shuttle, an'
that voice o' thine treblin' like a brid!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do ged on wi' yor tale, Malachi; what does Mr. Penrose
want to know abaat lasses o' forty year sin'? He's geddin' one o'
his own&mdash;and that's enough for him, aw'm sure.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page316" id="page316" title="316"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Aw nobbud want him to know that there were bonnie lasses
i' aar time as well as i' his&mdash;that were all, Betty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, ged on wi' yo', an' durnd be so long abaat it,
Malachi.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;One day, Mr. Penrose, as aw were peepin' through th' hoile
i' th' warehaase dur at Betty, aw could see that there were summat
wrong wi' one o' th' warps, for hoo were reachin' and sweatin' o'er
th' loom, an' th' tackler were stannin' at her side, an' a deal too
near and o' for my likin', aw con tell yo'.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just as hoo were stretchin' her arm, and bendin' her
shoulders to get owd o' th' ends, the tackler up wi' his an' clips
her raand th' waist.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, hoo were up like a flesh o' greased leetnin', and
fetched him a smack o'er th' face as made him turn the colour o'
taller candles. Yo' remember that, Betty, durnd yo'?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi! aw remember that, Malachi,&rsquo; said the old woman,
proudly recalling the days of her youthful prowess; &lsquo;there
were no man 'at ever insulted me twice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;When aw see th' tackler put his arm raand
<a class="pagebreak" name="page317" id="page317" title="317"></a>
Betty, I were through th' dur and down th' alley wi' a hop, skip and
jump, and hed him on th' floor before yo' could caant twice two. We
rowl'd o'er together, for he were a bigger mon nor me, an' I geet my
yed jowled agen th' frame o' th' loom. But I were no white-plucked
un, an' aw made for him as if aw meant it. He were one too mony,
however, for he up wi' his screw-key and laid mi yed open, an' I've
carried this mark ever sin'.&rsquo; And the old man pointed to a
scar, long since healed, in his forehead. &lsquo;Then they poo'd us
apart, an' said we mutn't feight among th' machinery, so we geet up
an' agreed to feight it aat i' th' Far Holme meadow that neet, an'
we did. We fought for over hawve an haar, summat like fifteen
raands, punsin' and o' (kicking with clogs). As aw told yo', he were
th' bigger mon; bud then aw hed a bit o' science o' mi side, an' I
were feytin' for th' lass aw luved, an' when he come up for th'
fifteenth time, I let drive atween his een, and he never seed
dayleet for a fortnit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' thaa were some stiff when it were all o'er,
Malachi,&rsquo; said Betty.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yo're reet, lass! Aw limped for more nor
<a class="pagebreak" name="page318" id="page318" title="318"></a>
a week, but aw geet thee, an' aw meant it, if aw'd had to feight
fifteen raands more&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;So, like the knights of olden time, Malachi, you fought
for your fair lady and won her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, Mr. Penrose, you morn'd think he nobbud won me wi' a
feight; he'd summat else to do for me beside that. Aw noan put mysel
up for a boxin' match, aw con tell yo'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, Mr. Penrose, th' feight were nobbud th' start like.
It were sometime afore th' job were settled. Yo' see, I were a shy
sort o' a chap and back'ard like at comin' for'ard. One day,
haaever, Molly o' th' Long Shay come up to me when th' factory were
losin', and hoo said, &ldquo;Malachi, arto baan to let Amos
Entwistle wed that lass o' Cronshaw's? for if thaa art thaa'rt a
foo' (fool). Thaa'rt fond o' her, and hoo's fond o' thee. If hoo's
too praad to ax thee to be her husband hoo's noan too praad to say
'Yea' if tha'll nobbud ax her to be thi wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Molly o' Long Shay were noan sich a beauty, bud aw felt as
aw could aw liked to ha' kuss'd her that day, an' no mistak'.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ey, Molly,&rdquo; aw said, &ldquo;if aw thought
thaa spok' truth, aw'd see Betty to-neet.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page319" id="page319" title="319"></a>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;See her, mon,&rdquo; hoo said, &ldquo;an' get th'
job sattled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, yo' mun know, Mr. Penrose, that Betty's faither were
fond o' rootin' i' plants, an' as aw'd a turn that way mysel I
thought aw'd just walk up as far as his haase, and buy a twothree,
and try and hev a word wi' Betty i' th' bargain. So aw weshed mysel,
and donned mi Sunday best, and went up.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When aw geet theer, Betty were i' th' garden by hersel, as
her faither were gone to a deacons' meetin' at Rehoboth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What arto doin' up here, Malachi?&rdquo; hoo
sez.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I've nobbud come up to see thi faither abaat some
flaars,&rdquo; aw stuttered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He'll noan be up for an hour or two yet,&rdquo; hoo
said. &ldquo;He's gone to Rehoboth. Is it a flaar as aw con get for
thee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yi!&rdquo; aw sez, &ldquo;yo' con get me th' flaar
aw want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Which is it?&rdquo; said hoo. &ldquo;Is it one o'
those lilies mi faither geet fro' th' hall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nowe,&rdquo; aw said; &ldquo;it didn't come fro'
th' hall; it awlus grow'd here.&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page320" id="page320" title="320"></a>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, if thaa'll tell me which it is, thaa shall
hev it; where abaats is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mr. Penrose, did yo' ever try an' shap' your mouth to tell
a lass as yo' luved hir?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose remained silent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, if ever yo' did, then yo' know haa aw felt when hoo
axed me where th' flaar were as aw wanted. Aw couldn't for shame to
tell her. Then hoo turned on me an' said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If thaa'll tell me where the flaar is I'll give it
thee, but don't stand grinnin' theer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then aw plucked up like. Aw said: &ldquo;Aw think thaa
knows where th' flaar is, Betty. An' as thaa said I mun hev it, I'll
tak' it.&rdquo; And I gave her a kuss on th' cheek 'at were nearest
to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And did she strike you as she struck the tackler?&rsquo;
asked Mr.  Penrose.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did hoo strike me&mdash;? Nowe; hoo turned t'other cheek
and geet a better and longer kuss nor th' first.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;So that is how Malachi won you, is it, Betty? The story is
worth a chapter in a novel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, aw wernd so easily won as that, Mr.
<a class="pagebreak" name="page321" id="page321" title="321"></a>
Penrose. There were summat else i' th' way, and aw welly thought
once he'd ha' lost me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what was that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, yo' see,&rsquo; said Malachi, &lsquo;Betty were a
dipper, an' I were a sprinkler. And when I axed th' old mon for
Betty he said as dippin' and sprinklin' wouldn't piece up. And then
hoo were a Calvin an' I were a Methody, and that were wur and
wur.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Th' owd mon stood to his gun, and wouldn't say
&ldquo;Yez&rdquo; till I gave in; an' aw stood to mi gun, and to
Betty an' o', an' towd her faither 'at aw were as good as ony on
'em. One day th' lass come to me wi' tears in her een, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Malachi, didsto ever read Solomon's
Song?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yi, forsure aw did. Why doesto ax me that
question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Doesto remember th' seventh verse o' th' last
chapter?&rdquo; hoo said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Aw cannot say as 'ow I do. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It's that,&rdquo; said hoo, puttin' her little
Bible i' my hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And when I tuk it aw read, &ldquo;Many waters cannot
quench love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; aw sez, &ldquo;what abaat
that?&rdquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page322" id="page322" title="322"></a>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; hoo cried, &ldquo;thaa'rt lettin'
Rehoboth waters quench thine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Haa doesto mean?&rdquo; aw axed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why, thaa willn't be dipped for
me.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Penrose broke into a hearty laugh, and complimented
Betty, telling her she was the sort of woman to make &lsquo;converts
to the cause.&rsquo; Then old Malachi put on his wisest look, and
continued:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mr. Penrose, aw mut as weel tell yo' afore yo' get wed,
that it's no use feightin' agen a woman. They're like Bill o' th'
Goit's donkey, they'll goa their own gate, an' th' more yo' bother
wi' 'em th' wur they are. A mon's wife mak's him. Hoo shap's
everythin' for him, his clooas, his gate, and his religion an' o'.
Talk abaat clay i' th' honds o' th' potter, why it's naught to a man
i' th' honds o' his missus.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;So you were baptized for the love of Betty, were you,
Malachi?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi; bud I were no hypocrite abaat it, for aw told her aw
should never be a Calvin, an' aw never have bin. Doesto remember
what thaa said, Betty, when aw tell'd thee aw should never be a
Calvin?&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page323" id="page323" title="323"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, aw forget, lad; it's so long sin'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bud aw haven't forgetten. Thaa said, &ldquo;Never mind,
thaa's no need to tell mi faither that; thaa can keep it to
thisel.&rdquo; Aw'll tell yo' what, Mr. Penrose, a woman's as deep
as th' Longridge pit shaft.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, thaa's never rued o'er joinin' Rehoboth,
Malachi.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I've never rued o'er weddin' thee, lass; an' aw think if
thaa'd gone to a wur place nor Rehoboth aw should ha' followed thee.
Leastways, I shouldn't ha' liked thee to 'a' tempted me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But thaa's not tell'd him all, Malachi.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, lass, aw hevn't, but aw will. Have yo' seen yon
rose-tree that grows under the winder&mdash;that tree that is welly
full durin' th' season?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The minister nodded.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, when aw fetched her fro' her faither, hoo said aw
mun tak a flaar an' o', as aw coomd for one on th' neet as aw geet
her. So aw took one o' th' owd felley's rose-trees, an' planted it
under aar winder theer, and theer it's stood for nigh on forty year,
come blow, come snow,
<a class="pagebreak" name="page324" id="page324" title="324"></a>
come sun, come shade, an' the roses are still as fresh an' sweet as
ever. An' so art thaa, owd lass,&rsquo; and Malachi got up and
kissed into bloom the faded, yet healthy, cheek of Betty, his
conquest of whom he had just narrated to Mr.  Penrose, and whom he
still so dearly loved.</p>

<h2>VIII.</h2><h2>MR. PENROSE BRINGS HOME A BRIDE.</h2>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page326" id="page326" title="326"></a>
<a class="pagebreak" name="page327" id="page327" title="327"></a>
<p>When Rehoboth heard of the coming marriage of Mr. Penrose many
were its speculations on the woman he was taking for wife. Amos
Entwistle said &lsquo;he'd be bun for't that th' lass wouldn't be
baat brass noather in her pocket nor in her face&rsquo;; to which
old Enoch's wife replied that &lsquo;hoo'd need both i' Rehoboth,
where they fed th' parson on scaplins (stone chippings), and teed
his tung with deacons' resolutions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Milly wondered &lsquo;if th' lass 'ud be pratty,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;what colour her een 'ud be&rsquo;; while old Joseph declared
&lsquo;hoo'd be mighty high-minded, but that hoo were comin' to
wheer hoo'd be takken daan a bit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The most philosophic judgment was that of Malachi o' th' Mount,
who, turning on Amos one evening in the chapel yard, said:</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page328" id="page328" title="328"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, owd lad; it were yor pleasure to stop single;
it were mine to get wed. We both on us pleeased aarsels; let th'
parson do th' same. He'll noan ax thee to live wi' th' lass; he'll
live wi' her hissel. Then let him pleease hissel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>One or two of the women vexed themselves as to whether she would
be a Martha or a Mary; and when Deborah Heap was appealed to she
said, &lsquo;Let's hope hoo'll be a bit o' both.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Old Joseph, overhearing this last remark, injected his venom by
hinting that &lsquo;no doubt hoo'd be a Mary, but that th' maister
at whose feet hoo'd sit would be a different sort to Him as went to
Bethany.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then it was Abraham Lord's wife suggested that Joseph should
&lsquo;find th' parson a pair o' wings, so as he might mate hissel
wi' a angel, for she was sure naught less 'ud suit Rehoboth
fo'k.&rsquo; And Oliver o' Deaf Martha's wife climaxed the
discussion by saying, &lsquo;if that were bein' a parson's wife,
hoo'd rather be where hoo were, although their Oliver did tak' drink
and ooine (punish) her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I'll tell thee what, lad,&rsquo; said Mrs. Lord to her
husband on the night of the chapel yard
<a class="pagebreak" name="page329" id="page329" title="329"></a>
conclave&mdash;&lsquo;I'll tell thee what. I feel fair grieved for
that lass th' parson's wed. They'n mad' up their minds they'll never
tak' to her; and there's no changin' th' mind o'
Rehoboth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But we'll tak' to her, mother,&rsquo; cried Milly,
crossing, with her crutch, from the window at which she had been
sitting, to take her place at her mother's side. &lsquo;We'll tak'
to her; aw con luv onybody 'at Mr. Penrose luves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bless thee, lass! aw beleeve thaa con. An' we will tak' to
her, as thaa sez. Fancy thee leavin' me to get wed, an' livin' i' a
strange place, and all th' fo'k set agen thee afore they see thee!
It mak's mi heart fair wark (ache).&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But thaa knows, misses, hoo'll happen not tak' to thee an'
Milly.  Hoo'll happen be a bit aboon yo'&mdash;high-minded
like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hoo'll tak' to Milly if hoo's takken to Mr. Penrose, lad;
thaa'll see if hoo doesn't. Didn't he read a bit aat o' one o' her
letters where hoo said hoo were fain longin' to see Milly becose hoo
liked th' flaars an' stars an' sich like?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi; he did forsure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw know hoo'll tak' to me, mother. An' if hoo doesn't,
I'll mak' her, that's all.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page330" id="page330" title="330"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Aw don't somehaa think 'at Mr. Penrose ud wed a praad
woman, Abram. Do yo'?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I durnd think he would, lass. Bud then th' best o' men
mak' mistakes o'er th' women they wed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi; they say luv's gawmless; but aw welly think Mr.
Penrose knows what he's abaat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Th' Lord help him, if he doesn't! They say a mon hes to ax
his wife if he's to live.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw yerd Amos say t'other day, faither, that a chap hed to
live thirty year wi' a woman afore he know'd he were wed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did th' owd powse say that, lass?&rsquo; cried Milly's
mother. &lsquo;I nobbud wish I'd yerd him. He's lived more nor
thirty year baat one, an' a bonny speciment he is. Bud it's a
gradely job for th' woman 'at missed him. He were welly weddin'
Malachi o' th' Mount's wife once over.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi; hoo'd a lucky miss, an' no mistak'. But happen hoo'd
ha' snapped him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never, lad. There's some felleys that no woman can shap',
and Amos is one o' em.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw towd him, faither, that yo' know'd yo'
<a class="pagebreak" name="page331" id="page331" title="331"></a>
were wed, and yo'd nobbud been agate seventeen year.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An' what did he say to that, Milly?&rsquo; asked her
mother.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, he towd me aw know'd too mich.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And at this both Abraham and his wife joined in hearty
laughter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When does Penrose bring his wife to Rehoboth,
missis?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Saturday neet. We's see her for th' fust time o' Sunday
mornin'.  Hoo's baan to sit wi' Dr. Hale.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There'll be some een on her, aw bet,&rsquo; said
Abraham.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wernd there, just. Poor lass! I could fair cry for her
when aw think abaat it. An' away fro' her mother, an' o'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But then hoo'll hev her husband, wernd hoo?&rsquo; asked
Milly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;For sure hoo will; bud he'll be i' th' pulpit, and not
agen her to keep her fro' bein' 'onely like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ey, mother, aw sometimes think it must be a grand thing
for a woman to see her felley in a pulpit.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page332" id="page332" title="332"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Don't thee go soft on parsons, lass,&rsquo; said her
father.</p>

<p>If there had been no other welcome to the minister's wife on her
Sabbath advent at Rehoboth, there was the welcome of
Nature&mdash;the welcome born of the bridal hour of morn with
moorland, when the awakening day bends over, and clasps with its
glory the underlying and far-reaching hills. From out a cloudless
sky&mdash;save where wreaths of vapour fringed the rounding
blue&mdash;the sun put forth his golden arms towards the heathery
sweeps that lay with their rounded bosoms greedy for his embrace,
and gave himself in wantonness to his bride, kissing her fair face
into blushing loveliness, and calling forth from the womb of the
morning a myriad forms of life. Earth lay breathless in the clasp of
heaven&mdash;they twain were one, perfect in union, and in spirit
undivided. Rehoboth was seductive with a sweetness known only to the
nuptials of Nature in a morning of sunshine on the moors.</p>

<p>It wanted two hours before service, and the young wife was
wandering among the flowers of the garden of the manse that was to
be her
<a class="pagebreak" name="page333" id="page333" title="333"></a>
home, her spouse seated at his study window intent on the manuscript
of his morning's discourse. Intent? Nay, for his eye often wandered
from the underscored pages to the girl-wife who glided with merry
heart and lithe footstep from flower to flower, her skirts wet as
she swept the dew-jewels that glistened on the lawn and borders of
the gay parterres. She, poor girl! supposing herself unwatched,
drank deeply of the morning gladness, her joyous step now and again
falling into the rhythmic movements of a dance. She even found
herself humming airs that were not sacred&mdash;airs forbidden even
on weekdays in the puritanic precincts of Rehoboth&mdash;airs she
had learned in the distant city once her home. Was she not happy?
and does not happiness voice itself in song? And is not the song of
the happy always sacred&mdash;and sacred even on the most sacred of
days?</p>

<p>Alas! alas! little did the young wife know the puritanic mood of
Rehoboth. Behind the privet hedge fencing off the paradise, on this
good Sunday morning, lurked Amos Entwistle.</p>

<p>The old man, hearing the voice on his way to Sunday-school,
stopped, and, peeping through
<a class="pagebreak" name="page334" id="page334" title="334"></a>
the fence, saw what confirmed his bitterest prejudices against the
woman whom Mr. Penrose had married; and before a half-hour was
passed every teacher and scholar in Rehoboth school was told that
&lsquo;th' parson bed wed a doncin' lass fro' a theyater.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Standing in his desk before the first hymn was announced, Amos
cried in loud tones:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw seed her mysel donce i' th' garden, on God's good
Sunday morn.  I seed her donce like that brazened (impudent) wench
did afore King Herod, him up i' his study-winder skennin' at her
when he ought to ha' bin sayin' o' his prayers. An' aw yerd her sing
some mak' o' stuff abaat luv, and sich like rubbidge. What sort o' a
wife dun yo' co that? G' me a lass as can strike up <i>Hepzibah</i>,
and mak' a prayer. It's all o' a piece&mdash;short weight i'
doctrin', and falderdals i' wives.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And as Amos finished the delivery of this sentiment, and held the
open hymn-book in his hand, he reached over to administer a blow on
the ears of a child who was peeping through the window at a little
bird trilling joyously on the deep-splayed sill outside.</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page335" id="page335" title="335"></a>
<p>During the pause between the close of Sunday-school and the
commencement of morning service, congregation and scholars darkened
the chapel yard in gossiping groups, each on the tiptoe of curiosity
to catch a first glimpse of the bride of their pastor. All eyes were
turned towards the crown of the hill which led up from the manse,
and on which Mr. Penrose and his wife would first be seen. More than
once an approaching couple were mistaken for them, and more than
once disappointment darkened the faces of the waiting folk. With
some of the older members weariness overcame curiosity, and they
entered the doors, through which came the sound of instruments in
process of tuning, while Amos Entwistle, cuffing and driving the
younger scholars into the chapel, upbraided the elder ones by asking
them &lsquo;if th' parson were the only chap as hed ever getten
wed?&rsquo;</p>

<p>At last the well-known form of the preacher was silhouetted on
the brow of the hill, and by his side the wife whose advent had
created such a prejudice and distaste, unknown though she was, among
these moorland folks. The murmur
<a class="pagebreak" name="page336" id="page336" title="336"></a>
of announcement ran round, and within, as well as without, all knew
&lsquo;th' parson's wife wor amang 'em.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As the couple entered the chapel yard the people made way,
ungraciously somewhat, and shot the young bride through and through
with cruel stares. Mr. Penrose greeted his congregation with a
succession of nervous nods, jerky and strained, his wife keeping her
eyes fixed on the gravestones over which she was led to the chapel
doors.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sithee! hoo's getten her yers pierced,&rsquo; said a
loudly-dressed girl, a weaver at the factory in the vale.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi; an' hoo wears droppers an' o',&rsquo; replied the
friend whom she addressed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ey! haa hoo does pinch,&rsquo; critically remarked Libby
Eastwood, the dressmaker of the village.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, Libby; yon's a natural sized waist&mdash;hoo's nobbud
small made, thaa sees,&rsquo; said the woman to whom the remark had
been made.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, aw'd ha' donned a bonnet on a Sunday.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yi; so would I. An' a married woman an' o'&mdash;aw think
hoo might be daycent.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aw'll tell thee what, Mary Ann&mdash;there's a
<a class="pagebreak" name="page337" id="page337" title="337"></a>
deal o' mak' up i' that yure (hair), or aw'm mista'en.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yo're reet, lass; there is, an' no mistak'.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can hoo play th' pianer, thinksto?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can hoo dust one?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, aw'll warnd hoo cornd.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hoo thinks hersel' aboon porritch, does yon
lot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dun yo' think hoo can mak' porritch?&rsquo; sneered Amos
to the woman who passed the unkindly remark.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nowe, Amos, aw durnd. Yon lass'll cost Penrose some brass.
Yo'll see if hoo doesnd.&rsquo;</p>

<p>While this criticism was going on in the chapel yard, Mrs.
Penrose was seated in the pew of Dr. Hale, somewhat bewildered and
not a little overstrained. Here, too, poor woman, she was
unconsciously giving offence, for on entering she had knelt down in
prayer, Old Clogs declaring that &lsquo;hoo were on her knees three
minutes and a hawve, by th' chapel clock;&rsquo; while at the
conclusion of the service, after the congregation were on their feet
in noisy exit, her devotional attitude led others to brand her both
as a &lsquo;ritual&rsquo; and a &lsquo;papist.&rsquo;</p>

<a class="pagebreak" name="page338" id="page338" title="338"></a>
<p>During the afternoon there was a repetition of the morning's
ordeal, and at the service the young wife was again the one on whom
all eyes were fixed, and of whom all tongues whispered.  Never
before had she been so called to suffer. If the keen glances of the
congregation had been softened by the slightest sympathy she could
better have stood the glare of curiosity; but no such ray of
sympathy was there blended with the looks. Hard, cold, and
critical&mdash;such was the language of every eye. Rehoboth hated
what it called &lsquo;foreigners&rsquo;&mdash;those who had been
born and brought up in districts distant from its own. All strange
places were Nazareths, and all strangers were Nazarenes, and the cry
was, &lsquo;Can any good thing come out therefrom?&rsquo; And to
this question the answer was ever negative. Outside Rehoboth dwelt
the alien. In course of years the prejudice towards the intruder
submitted itself to the force of custom, and less suspicious became
the looks, and less harsh the tongues. Even then, however, the old
Rehobothite remained a Hebrew of Hebrews; while the others, at the
best, were but proselytes of the gate. It was the first brunt of
this storm of suspicion from
<a class="pagebreak" name="page339" id="page339" title="339"></a>
which the minister's wife was suffering, and she was powerless to
stay it, or even allay its stress; nor could her husband come to her
deliverance.  Milly, however, like the good angel that she was,
proved her friend in need, and all unconsciously, and yet
effectively, turned the tide of cruel and inquisitorial scorn first
of all into wonder and then into delight.</p>

<p>And it came about in this manner. As the congregation were
leaving the chapel at the close of the afternoon service, and poor
Mrs.  Penrose, sorely bewildered, was jostled by the staring throng,
Milly pushed her way with her crutch to the blushing woman, and,
handing her a bunch of flowers, said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;See yo', Mrs. Penrose, here's a posy for yo'. Yo're
maister sez as yo' like flaars, an' aw've grow'd these i' my own
garden. Aw should ha' brought 'em this mornin', but aw couldn't ged
aat; an' mi mother wouldn't bring 'em for me, for hoo said aw mun
bring 'em mysel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Penrose could not translate the vernacular in which the
child spoke, but she could, and did, translate the gift; and tears
came into her eyes as she reached out her hand to take
<a class="pagebreak" name="page340" id="page340" title="340"></a>
from the crippled girl the big bunch of roses, tiger-lilies and
hollyhocks which Milly extended towards her. There was a welcome in
the flowers of Rehoboth, if not in the people, thought she; and, at
any rate, one little soul felt warmly towards her.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Penrose looked at the blushing flowers and caught the
scents that stole up from them, and as she looked at the little face
on which suffering had drawn such deep lines&mdash;a little face
that told of pity for the lonely bride&mdash;a home feeling came
over her, and she felt that there was another in Rehoboth, as well
as her husband, by whom she was loved. To Mrs. Penrose little
Milly's gift made the wilderness to rejoice and the desert to
blossom as the rose; and, stooping, she kissed the child, while her
tears fell fast and starred the flowers she held in her hand.</p>

<p>That kiss, and the tears, won half the hearts of the Rehoboth
congregation.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hoo's a lady, whatever else hoo is,&rsquo; said an old
woman; &lsquo;an' if hoo's aboon porritch, hoo's none aboon kissin'
a poor mon's child.&rsquo;</p>

<hr width="40%" />

<a class="pagebreak" name="page341" id="page341" title="341"></a>
<p>That evening, as Mr. Penrose walked with his wife along the path
of the old manse garden, he turned to her, saying:</p>

<p>&lsquo;This has been a trying Sunday, little woman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; but I've got over it, thanks to that little lame
girl. It was her nosegay that brought me through, Walter, and that
little face of hers, so full of kindly concern and pity. You don't
know how hard my heart was until she came to me&mdash;hard even
against you for bringing me here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And you kissed Milly, didn't you, Lucy?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes. I didn't do wrong, did I?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No. That kiss of yours has touched hearts my theology
cannot touch. You are queen here now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yours&mdash;and always!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he drew her to his side, and kissed her as she had kissed
Milly, and on lips as sweet and rosy as the petals that fell at
their feet.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
